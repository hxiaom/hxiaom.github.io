## PART II Foundamentals of Regression Analysis

### Chapter 4 Linear Regression with One Regressor

#### 4.1 The Linear Regreesion Model

**dependent variable**

**independent variable** or **regressor**

**population regression line** or **population regression function**

**intercept β0**

**slope β1**

**error term**

#### 4.2 Estimating the Coefficients of the Linear Regression Model

We must **use data to estimate** the unknown slope and intercept of the population regression line.

**The Ordinary Least Squares Estimator**

The OLS estimator chooses the regression coefficients so that the estimated regression line is as close as possible to the observed data, where closeness is measured by the sum of the squared mistakes made in predicting Y given X.

**OLS Estimates of the Relationship Between Test Scores and the Student-Teacher Ratio**

**Why Use the OLS Estimator?**

practical: OLS is the dominant method used in practice. Presenting results using OLS means that you are "speaking the same language" as other economists and statisticians.

theoretical: unbiased and consistent, efficient

#### 4.3 Measures of Fit

How well that regression line describes the data?

**The R^2**

The regression R^2 is the fraction of the sample variance of Yi explained by (or predicted by) Xi.

explained sum of squares (ESS)

total sum of squares (TSS)

sum of squared residuals (SSR)

**The Standard Error of the Regression**

The Standard Error of the Regression (SER) is an estimator of the standard deviation of the regression error ui.

The units of ui and Yi are the same, so the SER is a measure of the spread of the observations around the regression line, measured in the units of the dependent variable.

SER = SSR/(n-2)

**Application to the Test Score Data**

The fact that R^2 of this regression is low (and the SER is large) does not, by itself, imply that this regression is either "good" or "bad". What the low R^2 does tell us is that other important factors influence test scores.

#### 4.4 The Least Squares Assumptions

**Assumption #1: The Conditional Distribution of ui Given Xi Has a Mean of Zero**

This assumption is a formal mathematical statement about the "other factors" contained in ui and asserts that these other factors are unrelated to Xi in the sense that, given a value of Xi, the mean of the distribution of these other factor is zero.

**The conditional mean of u in a randomized controlled experiment**. In a randomized controlled experiment, subjects are randomly assigned to the treatment group (X=1) or to the control group (X=0). The random assignment typically is done using a computer program that uses no information about the subject, ensuring that X is distributed independently of all personal characteristics of the subject. Random assignment makes X and u independent, which in turn implies that the conditional mean of u given X is zero.

In observational data, X is not randomly assigned in an experiment. Instead, the best that can be hoped for is that X is **as if randomly assigned**, in the precise sense that E(ui\|Xi) = 0. Whether this assumption holds in a given empirical application with observational data **requires careful thought and judgement**.

**Correlation and conditional mean**. if the conditional mean of one random variable given another is zero, then the two random variables have zero covariance and thus are uncorrelated. However, if Xi and ui are correlated, then it must be the case that E(ui\|Xi) is nonzeor.

**Assumption #2: (Xi, Yi), i=1,...,n, Are Independently and Identically Distributed**

This assumption is a statement about **how the sample is drawn**. If the observations are drawn by **simple random sampling** from a **single large population**, then (Xi, Yi), i=1,...,n are i.i.d. 

When the values of X are not drawn from a random sample of the population but rather are set by a researcher as part of an experiment. Thus Xi is nonrandom, so the sampling scheme is not i.i.d. The results presented in this chapter developed for i.i.d. regressors are also true fi the regressors are nonrandom. When **modern experimental protocal** is used, the level of X is random and (Xi, Yi) are i.i.d.

Another example of non-i.i.d. sampling is when observations refer to the same unit of observation over time. This is an example of **time series data**, and a key feature of time series data is that observations falling close to each other in time are not independent but rather tend to be correlated with each other. This pattern of correlation violates the "independence" part of the i.i.d. assumption.

**Assumption #3: Large Outliers Are Unlikely**

Large outliers can make OLS regression results misleading.

The assumption that large outliers are unlikely is made mathematically precise by assuming that X and Y have **nonzero finite fourth moments: 0<E(Xi^4)<∞ and 0<E(Yi^4)<∞**. Another way to state this assumption is that X and Y have **finite kurtosis**.

One source of large outliers is **data entry errors**.

**Use of the Least Squares Assumptions**

The least squares assumptions play twin roles

**mathematical role**: If these assumptions hold, then, as is shown in the next section, in large samples the OLS estimators have sampling distributions that are **normal**. In turn, this **large-sample normal distribution** let us develop methods for hypothesis testing and constructing confidence intervals using the OLS estimators.

**organize the circumstances role**: Their second role is to organize the circumstances that pose difficulties for OLS regression. As we will see, the first least squares assumption is the most important to consider in practice. It is also important to consider whether the second assumption holds in an application. Although it plausibly holds in many cross-sectional data sets, **the independence assumption is inappropriate for panel and time series data**. Therefore, the regression methods developed under assumption 2 require modification for some applications with time series data. The third assumption serves as a reminder that OLS, just like the sample mean, can be sensitive to large outliers. If your data set contains large outliers, you should examine those outliers carefully to make sure those observations are correctly recorded and belong in the data set.

#### 4.5 Sampling Distribution of the OLS Estimators

Because the OLS estimators β0-hat and β1-hat are computed from a randomly drawn sample, the estimators themselves are random variables with a probability distribution - the sampling distribution - that describes the values they could take over different possible random samples.
