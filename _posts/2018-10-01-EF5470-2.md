## PART II Foundamentals of Regression Analysis

### Chapter 4 Linear Regression with One Regressor

#### 4.1 The Linear Regreesion Model

**dependent variable**

**independent variable** or **regressor**

**population regression line** or **population regression function**

**intercept β0**

**slope β1**

**error term**

#### 4.2 Estimating the Coefficients of the Linear Regression Model

We must **use data to estimate** the unknown slope and intercept of the population regression line.

**The Ordinary Least Squares Estimator**

The OLS estimator chooses the regression coefficients so that the estimated regression line is as close as possible to the observed data, where closeness is measured by the sum of the squared mistakes made in predicting Y given X.
