Gottschalk S, Demidova E. Eventkg: A multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph[C]//European Semantic Web Conference. Springer, Cham, 2018: 272-287.

## Motivation

One of the key requirements to facilitate semantic analy- tics of information regarding contemporary and historical events on the Web, in the news and in social media is the availability of reference know- ledge repositories containing comprehensive representations of events and temporal relations. Existing knowledge graphs, with popular examples including DBpedia, YAGO and Wikidata, focus mostly on entity-centric information and are insufficient in terms of their coverage and complete- ness with respect to events and temporal relations.

## Proposed method

EventKG presented in this paper is a multilingual event-centric temporal knowledge graph that addresses this gap. EventKG incorporates over 690 thousand con- temporary and historical events and over 2.3 million temporal relations extracted from several large-scale knowledge graphs and semi-structured sources and makes them available through a canonical representation.
