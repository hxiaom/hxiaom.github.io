    《魔鬼经济学》作者、美国经济学家Steven Levitt曾说：从很多方面来看，Uber 呈现了经济学家理想中经济应有的模样。

    Uber不仅在内部设立“研究和经济（Research and Economics）”部门，同时让这些被称为“Ubernomics”的经济学家的研究成功融入到公司的产品设计、战略设计以及政府游说支持中。

    目前经济学家在科技公司中主要负责 4 个方面的工作：
    
    1. 微观经济学方面问题，譬如价格设置和产品设计问题，研究产品是如何影响用户的；

    2. 公司发展策略问题，包括对产业的研究以及对收购、合并等行为的评估；

    3. 公共政策问题（知识版权、隐私、数据安全等），Uber拿研究报告去游说各地政府就是一个例子；

    4. 法律和政府监管问题，协助企业面对反垄断和竞争等领域的挑战。

7. [36氪专访 明势资本黄明明：百度不是无人驾驶终极方案，和李想做的是千亿美元生意](https://36kr.com/p/5157592.html)

    2006年时，黄明明就以天使投资人的身份投资了刚刚成立半年多的汽车之家，并“陪伴”李想度过了此后的多个难关。在出行成为最重要的投资赛道之一的今日，两人的“战斗友谊”又迈上了一个新的台阶，明势资本是车和家的天使投资人之外，还与李想一起投资了一些自动驾驶的项目。黄明明评价李想“是少有的能看到汽车产业、出行市场终局的人”。
    
    总的来说，智能出行，造车——包括造车的产业链的上下游，这两项至少各占了我们三分之一的侧重点和资源，工业制造是另外的三分之一。 

    把车做好了是一个几百亿美金的事情，把出行做好是过千亿美金或者是甚至大几千亿美金的生意。

    其实大家都没想明白一个问题，就是造车根本不是新造车之间的竞争，而是跟燃油车之间的竞争。很多新造车企业在忽悠各种情怀，但我们说“别把消费者当傻子”，他可能听你忽悠情怀，来参加的你发布会，真的让他掏钱时，他会做最现实的选择——他一定是拿你的车和同等价位的燃油车去比的。

    如果我们按每公里使用成本来看，所有的网约车的平台、共享出行的平台，包括将来自动驾驶的运营平台，最后大家比拼的都是每公里的运营成本，这个成本拆解到车辆的成本，拆解到车辆运营的成本，包括燃料的成本，为什么大家说电动车会在共享平台里面未来的出行里面绝对胜出呢，因为从成本来说可能是现有燃油车的1/10都不到。

    黄明明：就是核心技术的窗口期。如果把自动驾驶放的长远一点的话，还是有挺长的时间窗口期的，但是在偏商业的运营方面可能更快落地。因为商业的运营对车、对传感器成本的要求相对比个人低很多。因为个人开车要处理的问题、面临的场景是比一个在有一定固定的场景和运营要求下自动驾驶要复杂很多。

    黄明明：其实还真的没有说咱俩定一个产业同盟计划什么的，我会经常向他求教哪些核心零部件，哪些技术在未来新的智能电动车物种上会用到的。有人问你们会想到投这个？就是我们在讨论车联网技术，包括车联网安全的时候，李想说了一句“先别扯什么车联网的安全，最基本车的数据传输现在的工业总线都支持不了，应该看他做底层设备的公司”。正好我们看到出了一家公司，我们就投了这家公司

    黄明明：是的，我大多数投资人看重自动驾驶的人工智能、强算法去投资，比如投一些无人驾驶研究的团队。所以特别懂人工智能和算法的团队比较受到主流一线美元基金的亲睐，估值也会很高。而我们投的这两个团队（知行汽车、流深光电）会跟投资人说，人工智能很重要，但现阶段用不到，现阶段需要的是一些基本的东西，对车辆的控制以及多传感器融合，而且是符合车规的、低成本的传感器的融合。有些团队拿一个动辄是几百万的传感器设备、强服务器设备的样车做一个方案，用户是无法承担得起这么高额成本的。

    黄明明：我觉得这是两个不同的时间点，产生资本的回报可长可短。但是像车和家李想这样的，他可能认为整个电动车，不要说下半场到来，可能连开场的口哨还没有吹响呢，车都还没面市，而且现在做的大多数是一代的电动车的1.0——只是纯电动车的，2.0是智能化汽车，3.0是具有自动驾驶的汽车，这是一个长跑，所以每个企业家对汽车出行产业的终局看法和判断是不一样的，但是他和产生回报是两回事情，这就是为什么经常老有人问我说，觉得有一些很不靠谱的公司估值涨的那么高，我们就说可能估值和产业价值会有时间上严重的背离，但是我们希望投的是那种真正在长期能够有核心价值的公司。

11. [Samsung's latest acquisition will help prepare 5G for self-driving cars](https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/17/samsung-zhilabs-5g/)

    Samsung has announced that it's acquiring a Barcelona-based startup called Zhilabs, and it's meant to help the corporation prepare for its 5G offerings. Zhilabs is known for its artificial intelligence-powered service, which analyzes networks in order to provide companies details about their quality and any issues they might have. The results from Zhilabs' analyses could help Samsung figure out how to design its upcoming 5G products, such as connected cars and various Internet-of-things/automated devices, based on the quality of the networks carriers can provide.

    On Wednesday, Waymo — a unit of Google parent company Alphabet — released a plan for how officers can interact with its cars.

    The basic idea: Police, fire departments and other first responders can call a 24/7 telephone hotline to speak to Waymo representatives, giving them the car license plate and location. Officers — or passengers — can also press a “Live Help” button inside the car on the ceiling to reach Waymo reps.

    The hardest maneuver for an autonomous vehicle is getting on and off a fast-moving highway. That’s why most self-driving cars “are crawling around coffee shops at 20 miles per hour,” explains Amit Nisenbaum, CEO of Tactile Mobility, a Haifa-based startup that aims to give smart cars the ability to “feel the road” the way a human driver does.

14. [Self-driving stories: How 6 US cities are planning for autonomous vehicles](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/self-driving-stories-how-6-us-cities-successfully-integrated-autonomous-vehicles/)

    According to the report, Autonomous Vehicle Pilots Across America, more than 50% of US cities are currently preparing their streets for self-driving vehicles, up from less than 10% three years ago. Some of these cities have also started testing autonomous vehicles.

    Arlington, TX - In August 2017, the city began testing a 12-passenger AV shuttle on a fixed route on non-public roads as part of a partnership with Arlington's Conventions and Visitors Bureau, the report said. There are now two shuttles in operation. The shuttles are staffed with "on-board information ambassadors" who can manually operate the shuttles if necessary. Since inception, the shuttle has given more than 1,500 rides. A second phase of on-street testing is next, and the city has issued a competitive Request for Proposals (RFPs) to bring autonomous passenger vehicles to a geofenced section of the city. The expectation is for on-street AV service to debut later this fall.

    Boston, MA - In 2015, the city applied to the US DoT's Smart City Challenge (which was won by Columbus, OH) and began mulling over what Boston's streets would look like in the future. Boston didn't win the Challenge, but used the research to focus on mobility and in September 2016 was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a focus city for future mobility. In January 2017, Boston began an AV pilot program on a fixed route with a rideshare program, working with nuTonomy and Optimus Ride. It was recently announced that it would expand throughout Boston, according to the report.

    Portland, OR - In the summer of 2017, the city opened a Request For Information to see how AVs could benefit Portland's existing public transit system. City officials are currently evaluating the 19 applications to figure out which projects to pursue. The goal is to provide service to people, not providing specific vehicles. The pilot is expected to reach city streets in 2019.

    Pittsburgh, PA - In 2016, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto agreed to allow Uber to start an AV pilot program. There is no written agreement with Uber, or with the other four companies that have since launched AVs on the city's streets. By not pinning it down to writing, it allows the companies to stay nimble and embrace innovation. As noted in the report, another RFP is expected to open this year for the next chapter of AVs in the city of Pittsburgh with a focus on public transportation and first mile/last mile gaps. Use cases might include micro transit, medium-sized shuttles or city buses.

    San Jose, CA - This California city is interested in having shared autonomous electric vehicles to integrate with public transit as part of a public-private partnership. After realizing some major tech companies in the area were using city streets for private testing, city officials decided to take an active role in shaping how self-driving vehicles would affect San Jose. The city hosted a roundtable with the mayor and more than 30 private sector AV developers as well as US DoT officials, and in June 2017, began seeking AV developers to work with the city. Vehicles are expected to roll out in early 2019, the report noted, and the current plan is for a fixed-route pilot with established pick up and drop off points.

    Chandler, AZ - Chandler is basically a suburb to the south of Phoenix, and it's home to several large tech companies, including Intel, NXP Semiconductors, and Rogers Corp. The General Motors IT Innovation Center is also located in Chandler, and many other auto manufacturers have long had facilities in the area, since it's a hotbed for vehicle testing. AVs were first tested in the city in 2015, and autonomous vehicles have had a city-wide presence since 2016, as the city hosted some of the country's first AV testing on public roads. The city serves as a facilitator for AVs, with the state as a regulator. The city has tested emergency response vehicles on a closed track, and it's amended its zoning development code to reduce parking requirements by up to 40%, allowing passenger loading zones for drop-off and pick-up spots for AVs and ridesharing.
