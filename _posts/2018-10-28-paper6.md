## Motivation

A fully automated vehi- cle will unconditionally rely on its sensors readings to make short-term (i.e. safety-related) and long-term (i.e. planning) driving decisions. In this context, sensors have to be robust against intentional or unintentional attacks that aim at low- ering sensor data quality to disrupt the automation system.

Indeed, any attack that degrades sensor data can cause false driving reaction 

## Research goal

This paper presents remote attacks on camera-based system and LiDAR using commodity hardware. 

## Attacker model

Front/rear/side attack In a front/rear/side attack, the attacker installs the required hardware to mount an attack in another vehicle. Depending on the hardware, this can be installed without anyone noticing. The vehicle is then used to drive in front of (or behind of, or next to) the target vehicle. When positioned, the attack is executed once or multiple times. The advantage of this attack scenario is that it allows an attacker to keep the same distance to the target AV for a longer period.

Roadside attack A roadside attack is mounted stationary in objects on the side of the road, such as the guard rail. The attack is not limited to one installation point, but can be spread over multiple installation points, potentially connected to each other (e.g. for replay or relay attacks).

Evil mechanic attack The ‘Evil Mechanic’ [28] has shortterm physical access to the vehicle, e.g. when it is parked or left for maintenance. For instance, an at- tacker can mount a jamming device on a (carrier) ve- hicle that jams other vehicles unknowingly.

## ATTACKS ON CAMERA

### Blinding the camera

Blinding occurs when the camera is not able to tune the auto exposure or gain down anymore. 

Three variables have direct impact on the effective- ness of the blinding attack. The first variable is the en- vironmental light. If the camera is positioned in a bright environment, the auto controls are adapted for that partic- ular environment, so more light would be needed to raise above the environmental light to reach a blind state. The second variable is the light source used to blind (i.e. wave- length), and the third variable is the distance between the light source and the camera. 

### Confusing the auto controls

### Countermeasures

- Redundancy
- Optics and materials

## ATTACKS ON LIDAR

### Relaying the signal

### Spoofing the signal

### Countermeasures

- Redundancy
- Random probing
- Probe multiple times
- Shorten the pulse period

## Result

Results from lab- oratory experiments show effective blinding, jamming, re- play, relay, and spoofing attacks. We propose software and hardware countermeasures that improve sensors resilience against these attacks.

## Contribution

In this paper, we present attacks on camera and LiDAR systems. As we think the most realistic type of attacker will be outside of the target vehicle, we only con- sider remote attacks. To assess the feasibility and sophisti- cation of the attacks, we only use commodity hardware (be- low 60 US$) and perform black-box attacks. Results show successful blinding, jamming, replay and spoofing attacks in different laboratory conditions.
