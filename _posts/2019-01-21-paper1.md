The architecture of the autonomy system of self-driving cars is typically organized into **the perception system** and **the decision-making system**.

The perception system is generally divided into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as **self-driving-car localization, static obstacles mapping, moving obstacles detection and tracking, road mapping, traffic signalization detection and recognition, among others.**

The decision- making system is commonly partitioned as well into many subsystems responsible for tasks such as **route planning, path planning, behavior selection, motion planning, and control.**
