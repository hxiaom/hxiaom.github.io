Rodrigues F, Markou I, Pereira F C. Combining time-series and textual data for taxi demand prediction in event areas: a deep learning approach[J]. Information Fusion, 2019, 49: 120-129.

## Motivation

Accurate time-series forecasting is vital for numerous areas of application such as transportation, energy, fi- nance, economics, etc. However, while modern techniques are able to explore large sets of temporal data to build forecasting models, they typically neglect valuable information that is often available under the form of un- structured text. Although this data is in a radically different format, it often contains contextual explanations for many of the patterns that are observed in the temporal data.

typical approaches focus only on capturing recurrent mobility trends that relate to habitual/routine behaviour [1], and on exploiting short-term corre- lations with recent observation patterns [2,3]. While this type of ap- proaches can be successful for long-term planning applications or for modeling demand in non-eventful areas such as residential neighbor- hoods, in lively and highly dynamic areas that are prone to the occur- rence of multiple special events, such as music concerts, sports games, festivals, parades and protests, these approaches fail to accurately model mobility demand [4].

In order to capture the effects of events, one can exploit the vast amount of information that is shared online about what is planned to take place in the city. However, most of this information is typically in the form of unstructured natural-language text. Solving this cross-domain data fusion challenge then becomes key for understanding the mobility demand patterns that are caused by events, and also for addressing the general class of problems where text data from the Web can provide the context for explaining some of the patterns that are ob- served in time-series data. These, not only are quite ubiquitous and cover various research fields, but they are becoming increasingly re- levant as people share more and more information online. Popular examples include the use of text data from online social media to help predict opinion polls [5] and financial time-series (e.g. stock markets [6,7]).

## Data

a large-scale public dataset of 1.1 billion taxi trips from New York [11] and event data from the Web.
