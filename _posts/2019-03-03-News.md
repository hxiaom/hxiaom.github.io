1. [去年亏了9亿美元，“打车第一股” Lyft 要上市了](https://www.huxiu.com/article/286920.html)

    Lyft 今天向SEC提交了人们期待已久的 IPO 招股说明书，正式开启了自己的上市之旅。它寻求在纳斯达克上市，股票代码为 LYFT。

    招股书显示，Lyft 去年亏损了 9.11 亿美元，收入为 21 亿美元。不过，它预计收入增长将会快于亏损，并且它的市场份额正在扩大。Lyft 在 2018 年底占美国市场的39％，在两年内上升了 17 个百分点。

2. [Tesla’s controversial ‘full self-driving’ version of Autopilot is back](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/28/18245370/tesla-autopilot-full-self-driving-musk-2019)

    Tesla is bringing back its “full self-driving” feature, after removing the option from its website in October amid criticism the company was overstating the autonomy of its vehicles. The option is back on the menu as part of a shift in how the company markets its advanced driver-assist system Autopilot to its customers, coinciding with news of the company’s new $35,000 Model 3 and its plan to move sales largely online.

    Starting today, Tesla is splitting Autopilot into two packages: regular Autopilot, with automatic steering on highways and traffic-aware cruise control; and Full Self-Driving Capability, with Tesla’s recently unveiled “Navigate on Autopilot” feature that guides the car from “on-ramp to off-ramp” by suggesting and making lane changes, navigating highway interchanges, and proactively taking exits.
