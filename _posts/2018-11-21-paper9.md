Anwar A, Volkov M, Rus D. Changinow: A mobile application for efficient taxi allocation at airports[C]//Intelligent Transportation Systems-(ITSC), 2013 16th International IEEE Conference on. IEEE, 2013: 694-701.


## Proposed method

We present an application that uses a predictive queueing model to efficiently allocate taxis. The system uses observed taxi and flight data at each of the four terminals of Singapore’s Changi Airport to estimate the expected waiting time and queue length for taxis arriving at these terminals, and then sends taxis to terminals where demand is highest. We propose a service model that enables our system to be deployed on a smartphone platform to participating taxi drivers. We present the theoretical details which underpin our prediction engine and corroborate our theory with several targeted numer- ical simulations. Finally, we evaluate the performance of this system in large-scale experiments and show that our system achieves a significant improvement in both passenger and taxi waiting time.

## Contribution

• data mining algorithms to find the average waiting time, arrival rate, departure rate and queue length of taxis waiting at any given terminal,

• a first study on quantifying the imbalance of taxi supply at terminals of airports,

• a queuing model and an automated planning system that can be used to send taxis to an airport terminal when demand is high, 

• lastly, a direct comparison between simulated taxi and passenger waiting times in the current system versus one that uses ChangiNOW
