1. [「知行科技」发布L3自动驾驶方案，已与多家主机厂签订产品订单](https://36kr.com/p/5164951.html)

    1 月 30 日，自动那个驾驶研发商「知行科技」在苏州举办了年度发布会，并对外公布了 L3 级自动驾驶量产级详细方案，包括 iMo Pilot3.0 三级自动驾驶系统、iMo DCU3.0 三级自动驾驶中央域控制器与 iMo IFC1.0 智能前视摄像头。

    创始人兼 CEO 宋阳透露，目前知行科技可对外输出的产品，包括了自动驾驶的中央域控制器与智能前置摄像头等安全件。今年 6 月，知行科技已经完成了 L2 级自动驾驶系统的研发和测试，同时取得了上汽、众泰等主机厂的合同，车型订单超过每年 10 万台。

3. [BMW says Level 5 self-driving car for public could happen by 2021](https://www.motorauthority.com/news/1120176_bmw-says-level-5-self-driving-car-for-public-could-happen-by-2021)

    On Tuesday, BMW executives said they could sell a car to the public that would be capable of driving itself—without a steering wheel. The only factors keeping them from selling a completely self-driving car? Government regulations and high-resolution maps.

    Klaus Froehlich, BMW Group Board of Management responsible for product development, told Motor Authority the company would be ready as quickly as 2021.

    In other words, BMW thinks it will be able to beat Google's Waymo self-driving car division to a wide market with its own technology. Waymo reportedly plans to begin a self-driving car taxi service next month.

    Byton aims to reinvent the car by turning it into the next generation iPhone. Other automakers have talked about turning their center screen displays into iPhone-like interfaces, but not the whole car.

    That seems to be the goal of Byton, which says it is creating the “next generation smart device,” “spaceship Byton,” “your self-cruising living space.”

    In a two-hour press conference streamed from Shanghai in English and Chinese to coincide with its press-conference slot at the LA Auto Show, the startup electric-carmaker laid out plans to bring its first SUV to market late next year, and showed a concept version of its next model, the K-Byte luxury sedan.

5. [Extremely Precise Bosch Sensor Will Help Self-Driving Cars Navigate Roads More Accurately](http://www.thedrive.com/tech/25129/extremely-precise-bosch-sensor-will-help-self-driving-cars-navigate-roads-more-accurately)

    Self-driving cars require an array of sensors to figure out things human drivers take for granted, like knowing the exact position of a vehicle on the road. Bosch claims to have developed a sensor that will allow autonomous cars to keep track of exactly where they are, right down to the centimeter. The new sensor will be unveiled to the public at the 2019 Detroit Auto Show in January.

    Bosch's sensor relies on data from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS), which is continuously beamed to the car through a built-in receiver. But Bosch acknowledges that this data won't always be accurate enough. Atmospheric interface could garble signals, the company noted in a press release, and it's not always possible to get a precise fix on a vehicle's position from orbiting satellites.

7. [The 5 Best Stocks to Invest in Self-Driving Cars](https://investorplace.com/2018/11/the-5-best-stocks-to-invest-in-self-driving-cars/)

    Tesla (TSLA)

    Ambarella (AMBA): Ambarella (NASDAQ:AMBA), whose past growth rates came from supplying camera chip technology to GoPro (NASDAQ:GPRO), reinvented itself by developing computer vision (CV1, CV2) chips for the ADAS market. However, the transition to the market of self-driving cars has not been without hiccups. In August, Ambarella forecast Q3 revenues of $55.5 million to $58.5 million, well below the $73.4 million consensus at the time.

    Nvidia (NVDA)

    General Motors (GM)

    Aptiv (APTV): Aptiv PLC (NYSE:APTV), whose shares are hovering near 52-week lows, earned a number of customer awards that recognized the firm’s adoption on advanced safety, electrification and connectivity.It won a business award for its six highly scalable Level 2+ ADAS systems with a major North American OEM. The auto parts supplier is pivoting its business toward software, compute and integration solutions. This transition is playing out because Aptiv is booking new business. It is clearly on the way to delivering a Level 4 and Level 5 automated driving commercial product.
