Chang H, Tai Y, Chen H, et al. iTaxi: Context-aware taxi demand hotspots prediction using ontology and data mining approaches[J]. Proc. of TAAI, 2008.

## Motivation

It has been estimated that over 60 thousand licensed taxis in the Great Taipei area are not occupied over 70 percent of driving time on average. However, the taxi company, TaiwanTaxi, indicates that even in rush hour, there are customers whose requests are not satisfied. The demand and supply are not paired, causing not only customers wait too long for a cab, but also taxi drivers waste time and fuel to wander around the streets.
