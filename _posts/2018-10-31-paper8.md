Gao H, Tang J, Hu X, et al. Content-Aware Point of Interest Recommendation on Location-Based Social Networks[C]//AAAI. 2015: 1721-1727.

## Motivation

The rapid urban expansion has greatly extended the physical boundary of users’ living area and developed a large number of POIs (points of interest). POI recommendation is a task that facilitates users’ urban ex- ploration and helps them filter uninteresting POIs for decision making. While existing work of POI recommendation on location-based social networks (LBSNs) discovers the spatial, temporal, and social patterns of user check-in behavior, the use of content information has not been systematically studied. The various types of content information available on LBSNs could be related to different aspects of a user’s check-in action, pro- viding a unique opportunity for POI recommendation.
