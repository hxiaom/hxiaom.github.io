    Waymo,  the former Google self-driving project owned by parent company Alphabet, is launching a commercial robotaxi service in the Phoenix area

    Dubbed Waymo One, this milestone for the company and nascent self-driving technology industry comes with caveats.

    The Waymo One self-driving car service, and accompanying app, won’t be available to just anyone. And for now, the company says it will have Waymo-trained test drivers behind the wheel (even though the company already has driverless vehicles on public roads in Phoenix).

    Waymo will first invite Phoenix residents who are part of its early rider program, which was designed to give a vetted group of people the ability to use an app to hail a self-driving vehicle. The early rider program, which launched in April 2017, had more than 400 participants the last time Waymo shared figures on the program.
