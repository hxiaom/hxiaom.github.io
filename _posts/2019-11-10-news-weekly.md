2. Liu, Yang, et al. "Attention-Based Deep Ensemble Net for Large-Scale Online Taxi-Hailing Demand Prediction." IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (2019).

    - Motivation: effectively ensemble different base models is a challenging but extremely valuable task.
    - Methods:
        - construction of an ensemble framework designed for spatio-temporal data to predict large-scale online taxi-hailing demand, where an attention-based deep ensemble net is designed to enhance the prediction accuracy.
        - Three attention blocks to model the inter-channel relationship, inter=spatial relationship and position relationship of the feature maps.
        - The proposed method is a kind of commonly used ensemble method which applies to large-scale spatio-temporal prediction.

3. Gohorbani, Amirata, et al. "Towards automatic concept-based explanations." (2019).

    - Motivation: interpretability has become an important topic of research
    - Research gap:
        - Most of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance scores, which identify features that are important for each individual input.
        - However, how to systematically summarize and interpret such pre sample feature importance scores itself is challenging.
    - Methods:
        - propose principles and desiderata for concept based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify heigher level human-undersantable concepts that apply across the entire dataset.
        - develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts.

4. [科学家心忧：电动车电池未来将引发电子垃圾危机](https://36kr.com/p/5264200)

5. Strale, Mathieu. "Sustainable urban logistics: What are we talking about?." Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice 130 (2019): 745-751.

    - Motivation: sustainable urban logistics is a trendy research theme that addresses societal, environmental and industrial challenges.
    - Research goal: to examine how the academic literature investigates sustainable urban logistics by using a survey.
    - Results:
        - Technical problems, the search for optimization and solutions and the dissemination of good practices dominate the topics and methods mobilized.
        - the literature pays scant attention to environmental and social issues, which are an important part of sustainable development.
    - sustainable urban logistics
        – Reducing transport-related impacts 
        – Reducing nuisances linked to logistics buildings 
        – Reducing energy and material consumption 
        – Developing logistics activities as a tool for economic growth.

6. Kindermans, Pieter-Jan, et al. "The (un) reliability of saliency methods." Explainable AI: Interpreting, Explaining and Visualizing Deep Learning. Springer, Cham, 2019. 267-280.

    - Motivation: Saliency methods aim to explain the predictions of deep neural networks.
    - Results:
        - These methods lack reliability when the explanation is sensitive to factors that do not contribute to the model prediction.
        - we use a simple and common pre-processing step - adding a constant shift to the input data - to show that a transformation with no effect on the model can cause numerous methods to incorrectly attribute.
        - In order to guarantee reliability, we posit that methods should fulfill input invariance, the requirement that a saliency method mirror the sensitivity of the model with respect to transformations of the input.
