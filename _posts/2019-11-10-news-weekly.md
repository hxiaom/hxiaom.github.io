2. Liu, Yang, et al. "Attention-Based Deep Ensemble Net for Large-Scale Online Taxi-Hailing Demand Prediction." IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (2019).

    - Motivation: effectively ensemble different base models is a challenging but extremely valuable task.
    - Methods:
        - construction of an ensemble framework designed for spatio-temporal data to predict large-scale online taxi-hailing demand, where an attention-based deep ensemble net is designed to enhance the prediction accuracy.
        - Three attention blocks to model the inter-channel relationship, inter=spatial relationship and position relationship of the feature maps.
        - The proposed method is a kind of commonly used ensemble method which applies to large-scale spatio-temporal prediction.
