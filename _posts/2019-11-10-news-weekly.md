1. [Uber says it may have to pay Waymo for self-driving car technology](https://www.chicagotribune.com/business/sns-tns-bc-auto-uber-waymo-20191108-story.html)

2. Liu, Yang, et al. "Attention-Based Deep Ensemble Net for Large-Scale Online Taxi-Hailing Demand Prediction." IEEE Transactions on Intelligent Transportation Systems (2019).

    - Motivation: effectively ensemble different base models is a challenging but extremely valuable task.
    - Methods:
        - construction of an ensemble framework designed for spatio-temporal data to predict large-scale online taxi-hailing demand, where an attention-based deep ensemble net is designed to enhance the prediction accuracy.
        - Three attention blocks to model the inter-channel relationship, inter=spatial relationship and position relationship of the feature maps.
        - The proposed method is a kind of commonly used ensemble method which applies to large-scale spatio-temporal prediction.

3. Gohorbani, Amirata, et al. "Towards automatic concept-based explanations." (2019).

    - Motivation: interpretability has become an important topic of research
    - Research gap:
        - Most of the current explanation methods provide explanations through feature importance scores, which identify features that are important for each individual input.
        - However, how to systematically summarize and interpret such pre sample feature importance scores itself is challenging.
    - Methods:
        - propose principles and desiderata for concept based explanation, which goes beyond per-sample features to identify heigher level human-undersantable concepts that apply across the entire dataset.
        - develop a new algorithm, ACE, to automatically extract visual concepts.
