1. [Incorporating World Knowledge to Document Clustering via Heterogeneous Information Networks](https://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2783374)

    - Motivation: One of the key obstacles in making learning protocols realistic in applications is the need to supervise them, a costly process that often requires hiring domain experts.
    - Proposed method: We consider the framework to use the world knowledge as indirect supervision.
        - We provide three ways to specify the world knowledge to domains by resolving the ambiguity of the entities and their types, and represent the data with world knowledge as a heterogeneous information network.
        - incorporating world knowledge as indirect supervision can significantly outperform the state-of-the-art clustering algorithms as well as clustering algorithms enhanced with world knowledge features.
