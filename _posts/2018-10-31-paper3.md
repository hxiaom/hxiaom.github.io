## Motivation

Internet platforms are increasingly enabling individuals to access and interact with a wider, globally dispersed group of peers. The promise of these platforms is that the geographic distance is no longer a barrier to forming network ties. However, whether these platforms truly alleviate the influence ofgeographic distance remains unexplored.

## Research Question

A few recent studies have examined this issue [10] suggesting that distance adversely influences frequency and magnitude of dyadic ties in online context as well. Our study extends this literature in at least two ways. 

First, we isolate the extent to which geographic distance predicts the occurrences of dyadic ties by comparing its predictive power with that of the competing distance measures. Such an approach is necessary because a standard online platform does not directly provide geographic distance as an information cue to its users. Instead, it makes each user's nationality and other location information visible to other users. Therefore, geographic distance is only one of the several distance measures that can predict user's behavioral response. Any assessment of geographic distance as a predictor of network ties in an online context is incomplete without the inclusion of other forms of distances. 

Second, we examine geographic distance in a context that does not follow the two-sided platform structure which is predominant in the extant literature on distance effects in online settings. This difference is relevant to the occurrence of dyadic ties because on two-sided platforms dyadic ties are typically “cross-sided.” Instead, our setting allows any user to form a tie with any other user on the platform, broadening the possible pool of users with whom ties can be established. 

In sum, our primary research question is as follows: in a globally distributed network of individuals, in which users can create ties with any other user, whether and to what extent geographic distance predicts the occurrence of dyadic ties?

## Data

We address this research question by using a dataset of dyadic ties obtained from an electronic investment platform, which we refer to as XTrader. The platform is meant for the currency and commodities trading and has a user-base of over a million traders, representing nearly 100 countries. XTrader is an appropriate choice for our study for several reasons. 

First, the platform allows traders to form direct ties with each other. Because all the traders are engaged in the same activity (i.e. trading), there are no distinct sides to the platform. Hence, every trader can form a tie with every other trader. 

Second, a trader can create a tie only by allocating a certain portion of their fund to the other trader. That is, each tie that a trader creates has a cost associated with it, allowing us to consider the existence of a tie as a conscious decision on a trader's part for which the trader is likely to consider available information cues about a potential tie partner. 

Third, the platform provides each trader's country as the only demographic information cue. This cue is publicly visible to everyone. The salience of trader's nationality enables the distance mechanism to come into play.


## Result

Specifically, we determine the extent to which, compared to other types of distances, geographic distance predicts the occurrences of the network ties in country dyads. Using cluster analysis and predictive modelling, we show that not only the geographic distance and network ties exhibit an inverse association but also that geographic distance is the strongest predictor of such ties.

## Contribution

our study makes two more contributions. 

First, the cluster analysis reveals that the greater geographic distance is associated with fewer occurrences of ties. However, geographically nearer countries are not consis- tently associatedwith the highest count ofties. Apossible explanation is that greater geographic distance may be a sufficient to have fewer ties but lower geographic distance may not suffice to have more ties. That is, while geographic distance may have an overarching association with the count of ties, lack of geographic distance may make other dis- tancemeasures pertinent. Future studies could assess whether this pattern is causal in nature. 

Second, the predictive superiority of geographic distance suggests that at an aggregate level, individuals more readily perceive others to be distant/proximal on a geographic distance dimension than on other distance dimensions. This assertion seems somewhat contrary to the explanatory model which suggest that influence of geographic distance on the occurrence ofties is either substitutablewith other distancemea- sures [10] or absent altogether [32]. Therefore, additional work is re- quired to compare the predictive and explanatory models of distance effects in online settings. However, our finding is generally consistent with the extant literature because we find evidence contrary to the “death of distance” hypothesis.
