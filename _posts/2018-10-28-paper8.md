Barann, Benjamin, Daniel Beverungen, and Oliver Müller. “An Open-Data Approach for Quantifying the Potential of Taxi Ridesharing.” Decision Support Systems 99 (2017): 86–95. doi:10.1016/j.dss.2017.05.008.

## Motivation

Taxi ridesharing1 (TRS) is an advanced form of urban transportation that matches separate ride requests with similar spatio-temporal characteristics to a jointly used taxi.

## Research work

We develop a one-to-one TRS approach that matches rides with similar start and end points. We evaluate our ap- proach by analyzing an open dataset of N5 million taxi trajectories in New York City. Our empirical analysis re- veals that the proposed approach matches up to 48.34% of all taxi rides, saving 2,892,036 km of travel distance, 231,362.89 l ofgas, and 532,134.64 kg ofCO2 emissions per week. Compared to many-to-many TRS approaches, our approach is competitive, simpler to implement and operate, and poses less rigid assumptions on data avail- ability and customer acceptance.
