Sometimes a sentence fails to say what you mean because its elements don't make the proper connections. Then you have to revise by shuffling the components around, juxtaposing those that should link and separating those that should not. To get your meaning across, you not only have to choose the right words, you have to put them in the right order. Words in disarray produce only nonsense:

> Him stick with the before chased boy the that dog big had the attacked.

Ordered, the same words can make several coherent statements:

> The boy with the big stick attacked the dog that has chased him before.

> The big dog chased the boy that had attacked him with the stick before.

> Before, the big boy with the stick chased the dog that had attacked him.

> The boy that had chased the big dog before attacked him with the stick.

> The big dog chased the stick with the boy that had attacked him before.

Anyone at home with an English sentence knows without thinking that the verb normally comes after the subject and before the object and that modifiers usually go next to the elements they qualify. When words aren't near the words they go with, they go with the words they're near. So if you don't put your sentence components where they belong, you risk confusing your readers or getting laughs you didn't want. Take this sentence, for example:

> Queen Elizabeth read the speech, which was handed to her by the 71-year-old Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, with the aid of half-moon glasses.

Imaginatice readers might picture the lord chancellor handing the queen a furled parchment balanced on a pair of spectacles. The writer should have brought the queen and her glasses together:

> With the aid of half-moon glasses, Queen Elizabeth read the speech handed to her by ...

But not all faulty connections yield to simple transpositions. Sometimes you have to reword. Consider this sentence:

> We try to help clients interpret statistics with some sophistication.

Are the clients to interpret rather sophisticated statitics or to interpret statitics in a rather sophisticated way? The article that supplied this example ultimately makes clear that the with phrase goes with interpret, not statistics, but there seems no way to bring verb and phrase closer together. A change to help clients interpret with some sophistication statistics would scarcely sound like English, and a change to help clients with some sophistication interpret statistics would alter the meaning. In such circumstances you have to open up the sentence and give yourself a little more room to say what you mean:

> We try to help clients develop some sophistication in interpreting statistics.

You can sometimes detect faulty connections in your writing by reading aloud-a practice that can uncover a variety of problems by forcing you to notice individual words that you might skip over in reading silently. But the method is not foolproof, since your familiarity with what you want to say may distort the way you hear your own sentences. You have to train yourself to look at your sentences critically and objectively, and you have to know what to look for. This chapter alerts you to the most common word-order problems and suggests ways of solving them.

## Putting modifiers in their places

When an adjective or adverb directly precedes the word it describes, there's no mistaking the connection. Nor is there any problem with a modifying phrase or clause that directly follows the word it describes. But a modifier in an unusual position may fall into the wrong company and form an unsuitable attachment. Though readers can usually figure out what you mean, the momentary misreading can distract them from the substance of what you're saying.

### Adjectives

An adjective ordinarily goes before the word it modifies or after a linking verb (e.g., seem, appear, or become) that ties it to the subject. Occasionally, however, you may like the rhythm or force you get by putting two or more adjectives after the noun they modify, as in She was an able administrator, strong but tactful. This sort of variation is fine provided that the adjectives directly follow the appropriate word. In the following sentence, from a pamphlet on money managment, the adjectives have gone astray:

> Since dealings with a custodian bank are usually in writing, whether local or cut of town,the only difference is a lag of a few days.

It is, of course, the bank that is in or out of town, but the word order suggests that the adjectives modify writing (the nearest noun) or, if not, dealings (the more prominent of the earlier nouns). To revise, you need only move the words around:

> Since dealings with the custodian bank, whether local or out of town, are usually in writing, the only difference is a lag of a few days.

An adjective modifying the object of a verb expressing opinion (e.g., consider, think, judge, or find) also comes after the word it qualifies, as in He found the staff competent and I consider her work brilliant. But if the modifier cannot follow the object directly, the sentence may be hard to read. For example:

> The superintendent of the Ossining Correctional Facility found the community's desire to preserve part of the prison amusing.

Amusing cannot follow desire, the word it modifies, because the infinitive phrase claims the same spot; placed after found, it would seem to take desire as its object (but even a nonverbal adjective-say, ironic-would be disruptive in that position). So you would have to restructure the sentence:

> The superintendent of the Ossining Correctional Facility was amused by the community's desire to preserve part of the prison.

Or:

> The superintendent ... found it amusing that the community wanted to preserve part of the prison.

Sometimes, you may choose to stress an adjective by putting it first in the sentence and setting it off by a comma. Despondent, the boy left the room has a force you don't get with The despondent boy left the room. An adjective in this position ordinarily modifies the subject of the sentence. Readers will almost always make that connection whether or not you intend it, so be sure to match logic and syntax. Carelessness on this score can produce some bizarre results:

> Lightweight and packable, Mom will find this comfortable, flattering robe indispensable for traveling.
