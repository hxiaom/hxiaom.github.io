Sometimes a sentence fails to say what you mean because its elements don't make the proper connections. Then you have to revise by shuffling the components around, juxtaposing those that should link and separating those that should not. To get your meaning across, you not only have to choose the right words, you have to put them in the right order. Words in disarray produce only nonsense:

> Him stick with the before chased boy the that dog big had the attacked.

Ordered, the same words can make several coherent statements:

> The boy with the big stick attacked the dog that has chased him before.

> The big dog chased the boy that had attacked him with the stick before.

> Before, the big boy with the stick chased the dog that had attacked him.

> The boy that had chased the big dog before attacked him with the stick.

> The big dog chased the stick with the boy that had attacked him before.

Anyone at home with an English sentence knows without thinking that the verb normally comes after the subject and before the object and that modifiers usually go next to the elements they qualify. When words aren't near the words they go with, they go with the words they're near. So if you don't put your sentence components where they belong, you risk confusing your readers or getting laughs you didn't want. Take this sentence, for example:

> Queen Elizabeth read the speech, which was handed to her by the 71-year-old Lord Hailsham, the Lord Chancellor, with the aid of half-moon glasses.

Imaginatice readers might picture the lord chancellor handing the queen a furled parchment balanced on a pair of spectacles. The writer should have brought the queen and her glasses together:

> With the aid of half-moon glasses, Queen Elizabeth read the speech handed to her by ...

But not all faulty connections yield to simple transpositions. Sometimes you have to reword. Consider this sentence:

> We try to help clients interpret statistics with some sophistication.

Are the clients to interpret rather sophisticated statitics or to interpret statitics in a rather sophisticated way? The article that supplied this example ultimately makes clear that the with phrase goes with interpret, not statistics, but there seems no way to bring verb and phrase closer together. A change to help clients interpret with some sophistication statistics would scarcely sound like English, and a change to help clients with some sophistication interpret statistics would alter the meaning. In such circumstances you have to open up the sentence and give yourself a little more room to say what you mean:

> We try to help clients develop some sophistication in interpreting statistics.

You can sometimes detect faulty connections in your writing by reading aloud-a practice that can uncover a variety of problems by forcing you to notice individual words that you might skip over in reading silently. But the method is not foolproof, since your familiarity with what you want to say may distort the way you hear your own sentences. You have to train yourself to look at your sentences critically and objectively, and you have to know what to look for. This chapter alerts you to the most common word-order problems and suggests ways of solving them.

### Putting modifiers in their places

When an adjective or adverb directly precedes the word it describes, there's no mistaking the connection. Nor is there any problem with a
