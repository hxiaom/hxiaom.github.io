1. [Think the future lies in self-driving Uber, Lyft or Waymo cabs? Dream on](https://www.azcentral.com/story/opinion/op-ed/2019/03/10/uber-lyft-ipo-waymo-self-driving-car-ride-sharing/3070010002/)

    > Driver salaries, although significant, affect fares less than the cab’s utilization rate — the percent of miles it travels with a fare paying passenger. And that’s a problem because in some cities, drivers spend as little as 40 percent

    > Whether or not the likes of Waymo are tuned into this reality is unclear. The company seems more focused on offering robocab fares that are comparable with Uber and Lyft. That’s ironic given that Uber and Lyft fares are themselves heavily subsidized and costlier than owning a car.

    真的会因为很便宜而无利可图吗？最后的收费模式是如何的？

2. [Racist self-driving car scare debunked, inside AI black boxes, Google helps folks go with the TensorFlow](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2019/03/10/ai_roundup_080319/)

    > So even if the camera-based vision of a self-driving car was flawed, and unable to see black people, lidar should still pick out pedestrians regardless of color. And there's no guarantee autonomous vehicles are using the same models, algorithms, and datasets used in this academic study. The likes of Waymo are, hopefully, using something more sophisticated. Therefore, while it's certainly worthwhile investigating and flagging this up as a potential problem, it's just not representative of a realistic self-driving car scenario.

    一提出来就可以改正的事，并不会妨碍发展。

    费用问题再次被提出。
