Greenwood B N, Wattal S. Show Me the Way to Go Home: An Empirical Investigation of Ride-Sharing and Alcohol Related Motor Vehicle Fatalities[J]. MIS quarterly, 2017, 41(1): 163-187.

## Motivation

While significant debate has surrounded ride-sharing, limited empirical work has been devoted to uncovering the societal benefits of such services (or the mechanisms which drive these benefits).

## Research question

In this work, we investigate how the entry of ride-sharing services influences the rate of alcohol related motor vehicle fatalities. 

## Results

Results indicate four notable findings.

First, while the entry of Uber X strongly and negatively affects the number of motor vehicle fatalities, limited evidence exists to support previous claims that this occurs with the Uber Black car service as well (indicating that prior claims about the efficacy of ride-sharing, specifically Uber, may have been overstated; Badger 2014)).
