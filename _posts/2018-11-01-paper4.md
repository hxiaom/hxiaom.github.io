Nourinejad M, Zhu S, Bahrami S, et al. Vehicle relocation and staff rebalancing in one-way carsharing systems[J]. Transportation Research Part E: Logistics and Transportation Review, 2015, 81: 98-113.

## Motivation

A solution to the imbalance of vehicles in one-way carsharing systems is vehicle relocation which involves staff members to redistribute the vehicles between stations. Vehicle relocation, however, can lead to an imbalance of staff members between stations. Thus, staff members, themselves, need to be relocated between stations to perform the vehicle relocations.
