"Omit needless words," say Strunk and White, practicing what they preach. Their terse injunction sums up advice included in every contemporary style manual. Under a variety of headings-Officialese, Prolixity, Veribage, Preiphrasis, Windyfoggery, and Jargon-the experts agree that, when it comes to exposition, less is usually more. Surely most authors have read such advice or have heard similar strictures in composition classes, but economy and precision seem hard to come by.

Bad prose proliferates because writers model their style on what they read most, and their daily fare-whether textbooks, reports, memorandums, or newspapers-abounds in circumlocution. Educators, sociologists, scholars, lawyers, bureaucrats, technicians, and business executives are all notorious producers of gobbledygook. Here, for example, is a bank president addressing stockholders in a 1980 annual report:

With the begining of the new '80s, it is readily ascertainable that there has been little if any improvement in the overall national or generanl local economy. It is expected by some economists that a general upturn on the national level should come about sometime during mid-1981. However, with the increase in taxes starting in January, mainly an increase in social security, this will reduce the amount of free funds available for the stimulation of consumer spednding.

Someone less given to beatign around the bush migh have written:

In 1980 we saw little if any improvement in the economy, national or local, and although some economists expect an upturn in mid01981, the tax increases scheduled to begin in January, mainly for social security, will leave consumers with less money to spend.

A simple statement like this is usually harder to compose than a verbose one, but even if it came naturally, the banker might prefer the longer version. Straightforward sentences sound unimpressive to many writers, and officialese, creating tin ears, perpetuates itself. Unchecked by the efforts of learned and vocal opponents, logorrhea plagues the country. It's rather like smoking. This chapter can only warnof the dangers, describe the symptioms, and prescribe remedies, enabling writers who want to kick the habit to cure themselves.

Before we go on to examples and techniques, I should make clear that writing concisely doesn't mean composing sentences like "Me Tarzan, you Jane." It means omitting nedless words, the deadwood that does nothing but detract from both substance and style. The pruned sentence must merge not only leaner and clearer but also more graceful and more effective than it was, better able to do what you want it to do. Long sentences aren't necessarily wordy, not if every word counts. As good writers know, leisurely sentences have their purposes-to contrast with short ones, say, or to establish a desired tone. A sentence can be too tight. Sometimes you need a clause instead of a phrase, a phrase instead of a word. What you're after is a supple style; you don't want to compact your language, trading looseness for density. But you're not likely to run that risk unless you're a compulsive polisher. Condensing to a fault is so rare a failing that it needs only passing mention. Of course, if you'd like to change the last sentence to The rarity of overtightness obviates elaboration, you have something to worry about.

With these qualifications out of the way, we can turn to the problem of recognizing and excising verbiage. Certain telltale characteristics signal wordy sentences. As you read over your writing, watch for the symptoms described below, try eliminating them in the ways the discussion suggests, and see your style improve.

## Profile of a wordy sentence

You can almost detect a wordy sentence by looking at it-at least if you can recognize weak verbs, ponderous nouns, and strings of prepositional phrases. Each of these features typifies prolixity, and they often occur in combination.

### Weak Verbs

A rambling, unwieldy sentence generally hangs from an inert verb-the verb to be (am, are, is, was, were, being, been), some other vague, actionless verb like have or exist, or a passive form (the verb to be plus a past paticiple; e.g., is belived, was seen). Pay attention to the verbs you use, and when you find a weak one, try substituting something more vigorous. Ask what happens in the sentence. If you haven't expressed the action as a verb, you've probably buried it in a verbal (the to or ing form of the verb), an adjective, a noun, or a subordinate clause, as the writers have done in the excerpts quoted below. Exhume the action, make it a verb, and you're almost certain to tighten and enliven the wording.

Consider this sentence, quoted from a computer company's promotional material. It appears in a paragraph explaining that the new technology, by enabling employees to work at home, will affect real estate values:

More remote, less densely populated suburbs, whose lower values were often a function of hwo far they were from work centers, and small towns in rural locations, whose lower values were a reflection of the difficulty of earning a living, are likeyly to see considerable appreciation fo their property values in the next two decades.

If you check the verbs in this long-winded sentence, you can readily spot the trouble. The verb to be occurs in the main clause as well as in the subordinate ones-four times in all-while nouns and verbals (reflection, appreciation, earning, to see) freeze all the action. A little analysis suggests that the "event" in the sentence is the appreciation of property values. When you make appreciate the principal verb, it attracts the proper subject, and everything else falls into place:

Since many people will no longer have to commute to work centers to earn a living, property values in the more distant suburbs and rural areas should appreciate considerably in the next two decades.

Notice that the revision eliminates needless words as well as static verbs. While it may seem to leave out information included in the original, the omitted words tell readers nothing that they don't already know, nothing that isn't implicit in what's left. You could even tighten the wording a bit more:

Rural and exurban property values should appreciate considerably in the next two decades as it becomes easier for people to earn a living in areas remote from work centers.

When you consider substitutes for weak and passive verbs, you many have several good options, and the choice will depend on exactly what you want to highlight.

In the following excerpt, from a newspaper article on a town's plans to build an animal shelter, the wordiness stems from the passive voice, the form a verb takes when its subject is not acting but acted on:

The shelter will be owned by the town, but it will be run by members of the humane society and supported, in part, by funds raised by them. The bulk of the operating fundings, however, will be supplied by the town.

When you make all the verbs active, other economies suggest themselves:

Although the town will own the shelter and pay most of the operating expenses, members of the humane society will run the facility and provide additional support through fund raising.

The revisioin collapses two sentences into one. In the original the passive subjects shelter and bulk of the operating funds need verbs of their own, but when town becomes the acting subject, it can govern two verbs with different objects, thus enabling one clause to supply the same information that formerly required two.

The next example comes from a letter that the head of a college English department sends prospective major:

The English Department is unusually strong for a college of this size. It consists of twelve faculty members, whose fields of special interest cover the range of English and American literature.
