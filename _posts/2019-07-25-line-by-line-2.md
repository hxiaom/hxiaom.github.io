"Omit needless words," say Strunk and White, practicing what they preach. Their terse injunction sums up advice included in every contemporary style manual. Under a variety of headings-Officialese, Prolixity, Veribage, Preiphrasis, Windyfoggery, and Jargon-the experts agree that, when it comes to exposition, less is usually more.

A simple statement like this is usually harder to compose than a verbose one, but even if it came naturally, the banker might prefer the longer version.
