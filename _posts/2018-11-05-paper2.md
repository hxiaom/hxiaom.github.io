## Motivation

Taxi-calling apps are gaining increasing popularity for their efficiency in dispatching idle taxis to passengers in need. To precisely balance the supply and the demand of taxis, online taxicab platforms need to predict the Unit Original Taxi Demand (UOTD), which refers to the number of taxi-calling requirements submitted per unit time (e.g., every hour) and per unit region (e.g., each POI). Predicting UOTD is non-trivial for large-scale industrial online taxicab platforms because both accuracy and flexibility are essential.

Complex non-linear models such as GBRT and deep learning are generally accurate, yet require labor-intensive model redesign after scenario changes (e.g., extra constraints due to new regulations). 

Information of UOTD benefits online taxicab platforms in triple ways. 

(i) Expanding potential market. By comparing historical UOTD with the corresponding number of PU, the platforms can discover times and regions with strong taxi-calling motivation yet few final taxi rides. 

(ii) Assessing incentive mechanisms. UOTD reflects the willingness of users to travel by taxi after adopting new discount strategies and dynamic pricing. 

(iii) Guiding taxi dispatching. Predicting UOTD facilitates online taxicab platforms to allocate roaming taxis to passengers in advance. Hence predicting UOTD is a foundational issue in large-scale online taxicab industries. 


## Review

Despite extensive research efforts on taxi demand prediction [14, 15, 28], none of them are applicable in predicting UOTD. These works focus on predicting the number of PU. They usually predict the number of PU based on the correlation between PU and taxi trajectories. However, taxi trajectories are not always associated with UOTD (e.g., original taxi demands that are cancelled or without successful passenger pick-ups), making it impossible to extend works on PU prediction to UOTD prediction.

Due to their inherent complexity, real-world prediction problems are mainly solved by high VC-dimension models [20], which consists of two paradigms: (i) complicated (non-linear) models with a small number of features [7, 9] and (ii) simple (linear) models with massive sets of features [8, 13].

## DATA DESCRIPTION

### Original Taxi Demand Record Data

### POI Data

The three-level category consists of a coarse-level (Entertainment), a mid-level (Ourdoor Activity) and a sub-level (Playground), respectively. 

In total the POIs are divided into 16 coarse-levels, 83 mid-levels, and 155 sub-levels.

## Proposed method

To mitigate such heavy burden, we propose to transfer model redesign to feature redesign. Specifically, we leverage the latter paradigm, i.e., a linear model with massive features, to ease integration ofnew information with a unified framework. 

A natural question arises whether a unified simple linear model is able to predict UOTD accurately. We tackle this problem by integrat- ing high-dimensional features from heterogenous datasets. Specifically, we propose LinUOTD, a unified UOTD prediction framework with a linear model and high-dimensional (200 million) features. Fig. 1 illustrates the overview of LinUOTD. We first investigate multiple real-world datasets including original taxi demands (OTD), points ofinterest (POI) and meteorology. We then extract four types of basic features over **space, time, meteorology and event domains**, and generate massive combinatorial features based on the business logics of online taxicab platforms.

To accurately predict UOTD while remaining flexible to scenario changes, we propose LinUOTD, a unified linear regression model with more than 200 million dimensions of features. The simple model structure eliminates the need of repeated model redesign, while the high-dimensional features contribute to accurate UOTD prediction. We further design a series of optimization techniques for efficient model training and updating. 

### UOTD Prediction Model

## Result

Evaluations on two largescale datasets from an industrial online taxicab platform verify that LinUOTD outperforms popular non-linear models in accuracy. We envision our experiences to adopt simple linear models with high-dimensional features in UOTD prediction as a pilot study and can shed insights upon other industrial large-scale spatio-temporal prediction problems.

## Contribution

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort that adopts a simple linear model with very high-dimensional (hundreds of millions) features in predicting UOTD, to meet the requirements of accuracy and flexibility in large-scale online taxi- cab platforms. We transform the overhead of model redesign into feature engineering, and apply a distributed learning framework to support rapid, parallel and scalable feature updating and testing. Surprisingly, evaluations on two real datasets from the largest on-line taxicab platform in China reveal that our approach outperforms classical non-linear models in prediction accuracy. As a pilot study, we envision our successful experiences on adopting simple linear models with high-dimensional features can shed light upon other large-scale industrial spatio-temporal prediction problems.
