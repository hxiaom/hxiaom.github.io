## Motivation

recent development of “self-driving” cars and the announcement by car manufacturers of their deployment by 2020 show that this is becoming a reality. The ITS industry has already been focusing much of its attention on the concepts of “connected vehicles” (United States) or “cooperative ITS” (Europe). These concepts are based on communication of data among vehicles (V2V) and/or between vehicles and the infrastructure (V2I/I2V) to provide the information needed to implement ITS applications. The separate threads of automated vehicles and cooperative ITS have not yet been thoroughly woven together, but this will be a necessary step in the near future because the cooperative exchange of data will provide vital inputs to improve the performance and safety of the automation systems. Thus, it is important to start thinking about the cybersecurity implications of cooperative automated vehicle systems. 

## Research question

In this paper, we investigate the potential cyberattacks specific to automated vehicles, with their special needs and vul- nerabilities. 

In this paper, we address the following questions. 

a) How can autonomous automated vehicles be attacked? 

b) How can cooperative automated vehicles be attacked? 

c) What is the difference between security and privacy mechanisms for autonomous and cooperative automated vehicles?


We analyze the threats on autonomous automated vehicles and cooperative automated vehicles. This analysis shows the need for considerably more redundancy than many have been expecting. We also raise awareness to generate discussion about these threats at this early stage in the development of vehicle automation systems.

## Assumptions

The focus of attention for this paper is on systems that provide a high enough level of automation of the dynamic driving task that the driver is no longer required to monitor the driving environment for external threats.

## Attacker Model

Internal Versus External: The internal attacker is an authenticated member of the network that can communicate with other members. The external attacker is considered by the network members as an intruder and, hence, is limited in the diversity of attacks. Nevertheless, she/he can eavesdrop on the communication.

Malicious Versus Rational: A malicious attacker seeks no personal benefits from the attacks, and aims to harm the mem- bers or the functionality of the network. Hence, she/he may employ any means disregarding corresponding costs and con- sequences. On the contrary, a rational attacker seeks personal profit and, hence, is more predictable in terms of attack means and attack target.

Active Versus Passive: An active attacker can generate packets or signals to perform the attack, whereas a passive attacker only eavesdrops on the communication channel (i.e., wireless or in-vehicle wired network).

Local Versus Extended: An attacker can be limited in scope, even if she/he controls several entities (vehicles or base sta- tions), which make him/her local. An extended attacker controls several entities that are scattered across the network, thus extending his/her scope.

Intentional Versus Unintentional: An intentional attacker generates attacks on purpose, whereas an unintentional attack is a cyber incident that could be generated by faulty sensors or equipments. 

## Methodology

we first list the attack surfaces (i.e., the entry point of the attack) for autonomous automated vehicles, and cooperative automated vehicles. For each attack we define the following criteria:

a) Means: Describes the attack performed on the attack surface.

b) Feasibility of the attack (FA): Describes the level of knowledge needed to perform the attack.

c) Need for physical access to the targeted vehicle (PA):Is physical access to the targeted vehicle required to run the attack? (yes/no)

d) Ease of detection by driver: Can the driver detect the attack?

e) Ease of detection by the system (EDS): Can the system detect the attack?

f) Probability of attack success (PAS): Based on the previ- ous criteria, we assess the probability of success of the attack. 

g) Consequence for the vehicle: Describes the direct conse- quence(s) for the vehicle such as entering in minimal risk condition.

h) Hazard created: At a macroscopic point of view, de- scribes the hazard created by the attack (e.g., traffic disturbance)

i) Mitigation technique(s): Describes the mitigation tech- nique(s) that can be deployed to mitigate the impact of such attack.
