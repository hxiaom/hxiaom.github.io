    > China has its eyes set on making self-driving cars mainstream. In order to boost its position as a leader in this sector, the country is building a 100 km long highway with dedicated lanes for autonomous and semi-autonomous vehicles (AVs).

    > According to a report by FutureCar, this freeway will connect Beijing and the Xiongan New Area in Hebei province, and will be operational by 2020. It will have smart sensors along the self-driving car lanes, and a smart-toll facility for easier payment. The highway will have a speed limit of 62 to 74 mph.

8. [Waymo launches robotaxi app on Google Play](https://techcrunch.com/2019/04/16/waymo-launches-robotaxi-app-on-google-play/)

    > Waymo  is making its ride-hailing app more widely available by putting it on the Google  Play store as the self-driving car company prepares to open its service to more Phoenix residents.

    > Interested customers with Android devices can download the app. Unlike a traditional ride-hailing service, like Uber  or Lyft,  this doesn’t mean users will get instant access. Instead, potential riders will be added to a waitlist. Once accepted, they will be able to request rides in the app.

9. [Waymo CEO John Krafcik explains why a parking lot is one of the most difficult environments for a self-driving car](https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-ceo-john-krafcik-explains-big-challenge-for-self-driving-cars-2019-4)

    > As Waymo's ambitions grow, it still has to reckon with the obsessive attention to detail autonomous vehicles require. Self-driving cars must be able to handle small details in complex environments, like parking lots, which are challenging because they feature cars and pedestrians moving in unpredictable patterns and don't have road markings, Krafcik said.

    > Beyond mastering technical details, Waymo also has to anticipate the preferences of its customers. The company had thought passengers who were traveling to a grocery store, for example, would want to be picked up where they were dropped off — at the front door. But the front door is a major source of foot-traffic at grocery stores, and passengers told Waymo that they felt self-conscious loading bags into a car in such a busy area.
