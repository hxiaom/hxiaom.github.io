1. [Android收费的翅膀一扇，结果中国汽车打了个喷嚏？](https://www.huxiu.com/article/270401.html)

    面对欧盟的连续罚款，谷歌刚刚宣布Android将在欧洲开始收费，从11月起将面向硬件公司收取每台设备最多40美元的费用。虽然这项政策目前仅在欧洲实行，但被国际媒体广泛解读为Android收费政策的开始。

    如果像很多国内外分析师与媒体认定的那样，Android收费成为大趋势，那么对于国产汽车来说，有这样几个麻烦很可能在未来不期而至：

    1、使用成本可能加大，开发成本与测试成本也随之上升，突然让最省钱的车载系统变得不再划算。其实本身基于Android做深度定制，也是一个大坑。手机领域的小米就建立了一个规模非常大的UI团队，每一次Android升级都需要做新的匹配，放在汽车上这个过程也同样适用。比如小鹏汽车为此配备了数百人的团队。

    2、由于谷歌要推出自己的车载Android系统，很可能会进一步收紧汽车领域的合作。2017年，谷歌宣布将在2019年推出不与手机相连的独立车载Android系统，而从Android Auto的方案来看，车载Android系统很可能也要基于谷歌原生框架，换言之，很可能是国内用不到的。

    据路透报道，腾讯正在加利福尼亚州招募自动驾驶汽车工程师，加速无人驾驶技术研发，正式加入硅谷研究该技术的众多公司行列之中。

    腾讯开始在无人驾驶领域布局是在2016年，成立了自动驾驶实验室，并招兵买马进行高精度地图、融合定位、高精度地图等方面的技术开发。在今年5月，腾讯就在深圳开了绿灯，在一些公路上测试自动驾驶汽车，获得了深圳自动驾驶首块路测牌照， 在今年9月，腾讯还拿到了北京的自动驾驶路测牌照。

    从组建研发团队到取得牌照，腾讯在自动驾驶方面的布局已经从技术层面转向应用层面。在自动驾驶应用层面，腾讯在今年已经实现了L3产品落地。在11月1日腾讯全球合作伙伴大会上，腾讯自动驾驶作为独立品牌首次出现在公众视野中，在当天，腾讯自动驾驶还发布了模拟仿真平台、高精度地图和数据云服务平台等三大技术。

    据外媒报道，硅谷风投教父蒂姆-德雷珀（Tim Draper）称，要不是因为伊隆-马斯克（Elon Musk）在微博网站Twitter上发布的那个“已准备好资金”的推文，他私有化特斯拉的事情可能早就成功了，他也可能省掉后来的很多麻烦。

    It’s been a four-year wait since Harley-Davidson first showed off a concept electric motorcycle. Now, the production-ready bike — called the Harley-Davidson LiveWire — is finally here. Well, almost.

5. [Sharp rise in patent applications for self-driving vehicles in Europe, new study finds](https://www.epo.org/news-issues/news/2018/20181106.html)

    A study published today, 6 November 2018, by the European Patent Office (EPO) reveals that innovation in self-driving vehicles (SDV) is accelerating fast and finds that patent protection strategies in the area of self-driving vehicle technology more closely resemble those in the information and communication (ICT) sector than those in the traditional automotive industry.

    The study, “Patents and self-driving vehicles”, carried out with the European Council for Automotive R&D (EUCAR), shows that the number of European patent applications related to autonomous driving has grown 20 times faster than other technologies in recent years: From 2011 to 2017, patent applications at the EPO for autonomous driving increased by 330%, compared to 16% across all technologies in the same period. And in the past ten years, the EPO received some 18 000 patent applications related to self-driving vehicles, with nearly 4 000 in 2017 alone.

6. [How a Deal to Bring Autonomous Vehicles to Walt Disney World Blew Up](https://jalopnik.com/how-a-deal-to-bring-autonomous-vehicles-to-walt-disney-1830079947)

    Walt Disney once mused that it’s “kind of fun to do the impossible,” so it’s likely the animation mogul would’ve been impressed by last year’s reports that fully-autonomous vehicles could soon be shuttling passengers around the amusement park in Florida that bears his name. Driverless cars are, after all, one of the most challenging—impossible, perhaps—technological tasks of our time. But the Disney project has fallen into disarray, Jalopnik found, after the companies aiming to bring the idea to fruition ended up in court accusing one another of stealing blueprints for the crucial technology needed to make driverless cars work.

7. [Tesla To Have Full Self-Driving Cars On The Roads In 2019, Confirms Elon Musk](https://www.forbes.com/sites/jeanbaptiste/2018/11/07/tesla-to-have-full-self-driving-cars-on-the-roads-in-2019-confirms-elon-musk/#1e7d24736b34)

    Speaking with Recode's editor-at-large Kara Swisher, Tesla and SpaceX CEO Elon Musk said he's confident that the carmaker will achieve full self-driving next year, in 2019, ahead of any other car manufacturer.

    "I don’t want to sound overconfident, but I would be very surprised if any of the car companies exceeded Tesla in self-driving, in getting to full self-driving," confided Musk. "They’re just not good at software. And this is a software problem."

    However, in the race to fully autonomous driving, Musk does think that Waymo, Alphabet's self-driving car division, would be Tesla's closest competitor although he doesn't believe anyone comes close to Tesla "in terms of achieving a general solution."

    "You can definitely make things work like in one particular city or something like that by special-casing it," he added. "But in order to work, you know, all around the world in all these different countries where there’s, like, different road signs, different traffic behavior, there’s like every weird corner case you can imagine. You really have to have a generalized solution. And to the best of my knowledge, no one has a good generalized solution."

    Uber is moving to restart the testing of self-driving cars on public roads roughly eight months after a fatal crash involving one of its vehicles. The ridesharing giant has asked the state of Pennsylvania for permission to resume testing, reports Automotive News. Uber has also submitted a voluntary report to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) detailing safety improvements.
