1. [卡车司机生存纪实](https://www.huxiu.com/article/265484.html)

    “收入最次就是现在了。”他抱怨道，不管吃，不管住，五险一金什么的都没有。C师傅并非特例。全国从事卡车运输的司机有3000万人左右，其中2/3都没有五险一金或类似保障。

2. [Uber 加入共享滑板车的角逐，首批滑板车正式登陆圣塔莫尼卡](https://36kr.com/p/5155891.html)

    滑板车可以通过 Uber 的应用程序预订，用户需要花费 1 美元解锁，然后每分钟骑行价格为 15 美分。每分钟的计费从预订成功后的 5 分钟开始，以便让用户有时间找到他们预订的滑板车。用户使用结束后，需要按照指示停到指定的停车区，否则将面临 25 美元的罚款。为了与早进入的滑板车公司竞争，Uber 在圣塔莫尼卡的滑板车租赁将在 10 月 7 日之前免费提供。

    共享单车没能拿下的美国市场，却让共享滑板车做到了，这与美国的滑板文化、道路交通状况、政策法规都有不可分割的关系。备受资本追捧的共享滑板车领域，好像正在走着当时国内共享单车热潮时的老路。在经过一段时间竞争后，Bird、Lime 等领跑者优势明显，接下来或许会有公司直接出局。

    Last year, there were 5.4 million on-demand workers in the country. This year, there are an estimated 6.8 million people working in the on-demand economy, according to now-former Kleiner Perkins Caufield and Byers analyst Mary Meeker’s state of the internet report.

    Earlier this year, San Francisco ranked fifth in the world for the worst traffic congestion. But the SFMTA says the purpose of its survey is to “understand the challenges couriers experience while performing deliveries” in the city, as well as see what affect these courier networks have on the city’s transportation network.

    Japan’s biggest automaker and its most influential tech firm will jointly develop a platform to operate self-driving vehicles which can be used as mobile shops, hospitals and other services as they envision a future in which fewer people drive their own vehicles.

    The tie-up shows that even big, well-funded firms want to share costs and expertise in pursuing promising but risky automotive technologies that have yet to gain widespread consumer acceptance.

    The U.S. Transportation Department on Thursday said it would disavow 10 locations from California to Florida that on President Barack Obama’s last day in office were designated as federally-recognized "automated vehicle proving grounds."

    At the same time, the department is readying a new autonomous car testing initiative that officials envision will eventually lead to testing and demonstration pilots nationwide by companies, cities, states and others.
