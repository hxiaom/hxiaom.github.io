2. Krarup, Benjamin, et al. "Towards Model-Based Contrastive Explanations for Explainable Planning."
    
    - Motivation: Producing contrastive explanation like "Why action A instead of action B?" requires the generation of the constrastive plan.
    - Research question: complile user question to constraints in a temporal and numeric PDDL2.1 planning setting
    - Methods:
        - To give contrastive explanation is to reason about what would happen in the counterfactual cases.
        - The authors approach this problem by generating plans for counterfactual cases via compilations, which they call the hypothetical model, or HModel.

7. Nair, Suraj, et al. "Causal Induction from Visual Observations for Goal Directed Tasks." arXiv preprint arXiv:1910.01751 (2019).

    - Motivation: causal reasoning is an indispensable capability for intelligence.
    - Research quesiton: causal reasoning for completing goal-directed tasks.
    - Methods
        - 1) an iterative causal induction model with attention, which learns to incrementally update the predicted causal graph for each observed interaction in the environment,
        - 2) a goal-conditioned policy with an attention-based graph encoding, forcing it to focus on the relevant components of the causal graph at each step.
