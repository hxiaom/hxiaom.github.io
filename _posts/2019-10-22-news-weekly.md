2. Krarup, Benjamin, et al. "Towards Model-Based Contrastive Explanations for Explainable Planning."
    
    - Motivation: Producing contrastive explanation like "Why action A instead of action B?" requires the generation of the constrastive plan.
    - Research question: complile user question to constraints in a temporal and numeric PDDL2.1 planning setting
    - Methods:
        - To give contrastive explanation is to reason about what would happen in the counterfactual cases.
        - The authors approach this problem by generating plans for counterfactual cases via compilations, which they call the hypothetical model, or HModel.
