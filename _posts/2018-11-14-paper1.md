Pillac V, Guéret C, Medaglia A L. An event-driven optimization framework for dynamic vehicle routing[J]. Decision Support Systems, 2012, 54(1): 414-423.

## Motivation

The real-time operation of a fleet of vehicles introduces challenging optimization problems.

## Proposed method

In this work, we propose an event-driven framework that anticipates unknown changes arising in the context ofdynamic vehicle routing. The framework is intrinsically parallelized to take advantage ofmodern multi-core and multi-threaded computing architectures. It is also designed to be easily embeddable in decision support systems that copewith a wide range ofcontexts and side constraints. We illustrate the flexibility ofthe framework by showing how it can be adapted to tackle the dynamic vehicle routing problem with stochastic demands.
