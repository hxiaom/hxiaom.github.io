1. [在意外来临时，自动驾驶系统会选择撞向谁？](https://www.huxiu.com/article/280351.html)

    截至今天，世界上唯一一份提供官方自动驾驶汽车道德官方指导的文件是德国联邦运输及数字基础设施部门在2017年6月发布的《German Ethics Commission on Automated and Connected Driving》中文译名（暂）：《德国道德委员会关于自动互联化驾驶的指导准则》（后简称《准则》）。

    《准则》中首次尝试对部分自动驾驶涉及的道德难题给出官方解答：

    第七条中明确地指出，在极端情况下，自动驾驶系统需要将人类的安全置于首位，高于财产和动物安全；

    第九条指出，在车祸不可避免的情况下，自动驾驶系统中任何基于个人特征的选择倾向（比如：年龄、性别、身体和心理状况等）都是禁止的；自动驾驶系统在移动中产生危险时不能够牺牲不相关的第三方。

4. [Nvidia dives into a new business segment with Drive AutoPilot](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/07/nvidia-dives-into-a-new-business-segment-with-drive-autopilot/)

    Nvidia’s automotive ambitions seemed targeted solely on creating a platform to enable fully autonomous vehicles, notably the robotaxis that so many companies hope to deploy in the coming decade.

    It turns out that Nvidia has also been working a more near-term product that opens it up to a different segment in the automotive industry. The company announced Monday at CES 2019 that it has launched Nvidia Drive AutoPilot, a reference platform that automakers can use to bring more sophisticated automated driving features into their production vehicles. This is not a self-driving car product, although it will likely be misinterpreted as such.

5. [Report: Self-driving car startup Aurora is raising capital at a $2B valuation](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/08/report-self-driving-car-startup-aurora-is-raising-capital-at-a-2b-valuation/)

    Aurora,  the developer of a full-stack self-driving software system for automobile manufacturers, is raising at least $500 million in equity funding at more than a $2 billion valuation in a round expected to be led by new investor Sequoia Capital,  according to a Recode report. A $500 million financing would bring Aurora’s total raised to date to $596 million and would provide a 4x increase to its most recent valuation.
