## Motivation

One such challenge is minimising the impact of transport disruptions [4]: road congestion is estimated to cost an average of 1% of GDP across the European Union [4], while the absence of real-time information about the impact of disruptions is a major factor in the dissatisfaction with, and reduced attractiveness of public transport [10,11]. However, tackling such problems requires addressing the challenges of data interoperability, analysis, information extraction, and reasoning presented by such environments - challenges that Semantic Web and linked data are key technologies in overcoming [9].

## Proposed method

This paper presents the Transport Disruption ontology, a formal framework for modelling travel and transport related events that have a disruptive impact on traveller’s journeys. We discuss related mod- els, describe how transport events and their impacts are captured, and outline use of the ontology within an interlinked repository of the travel information to support intelligent transport systems.
