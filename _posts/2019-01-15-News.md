2. [电驱系统会成为新能源汽车的下一个战场吗？](https://36kr.com/p/5172007.html)

    “靠增大电池装载量来增加续驶里程不是根本出路，主流技术路线是提高电动汽车能效和充电便利性。”中国科学院院士、中国电动汽车百人会执行副理事长欧阳明高在12日的中国电动汽车百人会论坛（2019）上表示。

    在他看来，高效电驱动系统的技术变革将会在未来5年发生，即电机驱动系统高速化、高效化、小型化：转速提高，电机的体积、重量逐步减少，由于电机材料成本下降，电机成本也将会下降。

    美国能源部最近提出，面向2025年极具挑战性的目标:电机达到50千瓦/L，电机控制器100千瓦/L。在欧阳明高看来，“这个目标如果实现，将对电动车产生革命性的影响。”

    电机驱动系统在整车当中起了非常重要的作用，其性能实际上决定了整车的性能，包括驾乘性能、动力性能以及它的续驶里程等。

3. [新能源乘用车赛道拥挤，「博雷顿」切入纯电动重卡市场，今年想量产2000台](https://36kr.com/p/5171729.html)

    36氪最近接触到的「博雷顿科技」就是一家纯电动重型卡车研发商。该公司采用宁德时代的电池，自主研发包括动力总成（电机、电控、变速箱）、电池PACK（电池组件）、电池温度管理系统（保障电池温度在30度左右，电池寿命提升30%）在内的核心零部件，未来打算自主研发IGBT芯片。

    董事长兼总经理陈方明说，做纯电动重卡的原因之一是电动乘用车市场竞争太激烈，又面临量产交付困难、消费者不买单等风险。同时，在商用车领域，有政策补贴的大巴车最早使用新能源，但重卡在保有量和每年新增车辆方面，都比大巴车的市场要大，而且，电动重卡的减排量是电动乘用车的近100倍，是电动大巴的4-5倍，即使没有专项补贴，也值得切入。

    博雷顿成立于2016年，于2018年3月正式运作。陈方明说，他们在2018年入局，这个时间点很关键，因为新能源的价格从2018年开始大幅下降，电动车运营商不靠补贴也可以市场化。此外，2020年，电池的成本预计会降到每度电1000元以下，而动力电池是电动车最贵的成本。

4. [卖车、做金融和打造生态：新造车回答盈利模式之问](https://36kr.com/p/5172154.html)

    2018年下半年起，新造车势力的量产车进入市场。无论是自建工厂还是代工，他们的首要任务是把车卖出去。“我们的盈利模式其实就三种，第一个占大头的是卖车，第二是提供金融服务，第三是提供保险服务。”车和家创始人、董事长兼CEO李想说。

    “我们的核心来自于汽车产品本身的盈利，从长期看，NIO Life（指蔚来的周边产品）也可以带来一定的回报，我们现在已经卖出了一百万份产品。”李斌告诉雷锋网新智驾，他认为20%多是一个很合理的毛利率水平。

    事实上，李斌提出的20%毛利率并不是行业常态，或者说，它仅是特斯拉等少数公司的待遇。

    查阅相关数据发现，除了广汽集团整车（乘用车）的毛利率为19.49%和吉利达到了18.45%之外，其他如长安汽车整车业务的毛利率为13.31%，上汽集团的整车业务的毛利率则为11.82%。

    而对于特斯拉来说，情况则明显不同。根据特斯拉2018年三季度财报数据显示，三季度Model 3的毛利率超过20％。在此之前，小型汽车拆解公司Munro&Associates曾拆解一款当时售价5万美元的Model 3后，估计该款车的毛利率将超过30%

    “智能汽车制造是基础，核心在运营。”此前，小鹏汽车创始人兼董事长何小鹏因抛出这一观点引发争议。在后来的解释中，他补充了“生态”二字，将新造车势力放在了打造智能汽车的生态中。

    “运营体系可以分成很多种，”何小鹏进一步解释，“比如说对一个用户怎么运营，为什么用户会升级？我们还把它作为一个产品进行运营，为什么这些车上可以有硬件体系能够去供软件升级？这些都是在智能汽车在智能环节的想象力。一定要有新的不同基因的组织去思考、建设、制造和运营它，才能真正地把数据用起来，如果没有运营，我们的数据只是存储不是使用。”

5. [谁把捷豹路虎推下断崖？](https://36kr.com/p/5172222.html)

    那是捷豹路虎进入中国市场以来最辉煌的时期之一。“因为是进口车，供应量少，加之当时的越野车市场，几乎没有其余车型可选，所以捷豹路虎在当时可谓‘独步武林’。”华东地区一家捷豹路虎的经销商集团总经理称，当时部分车型甚至出现加价几十万还要排队的情况。

    小毛病多，是不少路虎车主对这个品牌的感受。各种论坛和网站上也能看到，对捷豹路虎的投诉频率大大高于同属二线豪华车阵营的其余品牌。美国权威调查公司J.DPower发布的《2018年度新车质量报告》显示，路虎和捷豹的百车故障数远高于行业平均值。

    “英国人一开始就没有想清楚，是要利润还是要销量。”上述经销商人士表示，“他们过于自大。”

6. [New FAA proposal would let drones fly over people and at night without a waiver](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/can-drones-fly-at-night-over-people/)

    Companies impatient to make drone deliveries a viable reality should have a win to celebrate soon. On Monday, Secretary of Transportation Elaine Chao announced in a “sneak preview” that her department would move forward with plans to remove waiver requirements for two key drone operation circumstances: flying after dark and flying over populated areas.

    “First, at long last, the Department is ready to issue for comment a proposed new rule that would allow drones to fly overnight and over people without waivers, if certain conditions are met,” Chao said.

    Those conditions include the stipulation that the drone operator has received special night flying testing and training and that the drone be outfitted with lighting designed to prevent collisions visible for “at least 3 statute miles.”

    The second major change would allow drones to fly over people without a waiver if certain conditions are met. Those conditions are designed to minimize risk to anyone on the ground, including restrictions limiting device weight to .55 pounds. Drones over .55 pounds would be similarly allowed to operate over people if they meet a set of requirements to prevent serious injury, including the absence of “exposed rotating parts that could lacerate human skin.” This requirement is mostly open to interpretation — rather than stipulating specific build necessities, the FAA would allow drone makers to get creative so that a collision would be less severe than a particular injury threshold.

7. [Self-driving car startup Zoox gets a new CEO](https://techcrunch.com/2019/01/14/self-driving-car-startup-zoox-gets-a-new-ceo/)

    Self-driving car startup Zoox  has selected its new CEO following the unexpected firing of co-founder and former CEO Tim Kentley-Klay in August. According to Zoox co-founder and CTO Jesse Levinson, he and the board of directors believed “that to take the company through the next stage and to scale the company, we thought finding someone would with executive and operational experience would be helpful to the company,” he told TechCrunch.

    That’s where, Aicha Evans (pictured above) comes in. Evans is Intel’s now-former chief strategy officer, and will join Zoox as CEO and member of the board of directors on February 26.

    Zoox’s long-term plan is to publicly deploy autonomous vehicles by 2020 in the form of its own ride-hailing service. The cars themselves will be all-electric and fully autonomous.

    While Zoox currently has clearance to operate Level 3 vehicles with passengers, it will need additional approval from the CPUC to operate its Level 5 vehicles without a safety driver on board.

    To date, Zoox has raised more than $750 million in venture funding.

8. [Hong Kong self-driving start-up AutoX in talks to raise US$100 million funding](https://www.scmp.com/tech/venture-capital/article/2181857/hong-kong-self-driving-start-autox-talks-raise-100-million)

    Hong Kong-based autonomous driving start-up AutoX is in talks with investors to raise a new round of funding to finance its research and development into self-driving cars.

    The company said it is in talks with investors about a new round of financing, months after the company piloted autonomous grocery delivery services in San Jose, California, in August. Last month, it received its first licence to test-drive self-driving cars in China. AutoX is understood to be looking to raise as much as US$100 million.

    Founded in 2016 by Xiao Jianxiong, a former assistant professor of Princeton University also known as “ Professor X ”, the alumnus of Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has built the company to “democratise autonomy” and make driverless technology universally accessible.

9. [Howes: Race to autonomous future far from starting line](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/business/columnists/daniel-howes/2019/01/14/race-self-driving-future-far-starting-line/2551323002/)

    In a note in advance of the opening this week of the North American International Auto Show, Morgan Stanley predicts investors will “place greater emphasis on Auto 1.0/Macro vs. Auto 2.0 in 2019.” That’s because automakers’ ability to generate revenue and profit in a plateauing car and truck market is critical to their ability to invest in expensive technology.

    The arrival of Auto 2.0 in any meaningful way is a process measured in years, Pradhi said, perhaps even a decade or more. Autonomous "robo-taxis" operating in carefully defined, or "geo-fenced," areas could be realized in as little as three or four years. A fully autonomous taxi could be at least a decade away — and then only operating in specific areas.
