1. [It Took Seven Minutes to Pull Over a Drunk and “Unresponsive” Tesla Driver](https://futurism.com/seven-minutes-miles-pull-over-drunk-sleeping-tesla-driver)

    At approximately 3:37 am, an officer pulled up to a stationary Tesla Model S with sirens blaring on Highway 101 in Palo Alto, California. After chasing the car for seven long minutes at 70 mph (the Tesla was driving just over the speed limit) the officer finally managed to get a peek at the driver.

    But the driver was completely “unresponsive,” according to the Los Altos Town Crier.

    The officer was clever enough to figure out the Tesla was most likely set to Autopilot —although that’s not officially confirmed yet — and called two additional officers to help him slow down Samek’s Model S safely.
