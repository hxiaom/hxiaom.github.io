Socher R, Chen D, Manning C D, et al. Reasoning with neural tensor networks for knowledge base completion[C]//Advances in neural information processing systems. 2013: 926-934.

## Motivation

Knowledge bases are an important resource for question answering and other tasks but often suffer from incompleteness and lack of ability to reason over their dis- crete entities and relationships.
