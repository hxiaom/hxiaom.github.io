- Science of Science

1. [A decision support framework for robust R&D budget allocation using machine learning and optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923619300569)

    - Motivation: government R&D budget
    - Research question: decision support systems to maximize the total expected R&D output
    - Proposed method:
        - R&D output prediction model
        - robust optimization technique to hedge against uncertainty

2. [A multi-objective approach for profit-driven feature selection in credit scoring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923619300570)

    - Motivation: feature selection in credit scoring
    - Research gap: standard feature selection only rely on statistical criteria
    - Proposed method:
        - extend the use of profit measures to feature selection 
        - develop a multi-objective wrapper framework based on the NSGA-II genetic algorithm with two fitness functions: the Expected Maximum Profit (EMP) and the number of features. 

3. [A Novel Method for Topic Linkages Between ScientificPublications and Patents](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24175)

    - Motivation: understanding the relationships between science and technology.
    - Research Gap: Previous studies on the linkages mainly focus on the analysis of nonpatent references on the front page of patents, or the resulting citation- link networks, but with unsatisfactory performance.
    - Proposed method:
        - a novel statistical entity-topic model (named the CCorrLDA2 model), armed with the collapsed Gibbs sampling inference algorithm, is proposed to discover the hidden topics respectively from the academic articles and patents.
        - a topic linkages construction problem is transformed into the well-known optimal transportation problem after topic similarity is calculated on the basis of symmetrized Kullback–Leibler (KL) divergence.

4. [Data objects and documenting scientific processes: An analysis of data events in biodiversity data papers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24226)

    - Motivation: data paper
    - Research gap: Research examining how data papers report data events, such as data transactions and manipulations, is limited.
    - Method & findings: 
        - A content analysis was conducted examining the full texts of 82 data papers
        - Data events recorded for each paper were organized into a set of 17 categories.
        - The findings challenge the degrees to which data papers are a distinct genre compared to research articles and they describe data‐centric research processes in a through way.

5. [Examining scientific writing styles from the perspective of linguistic complexity](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/asi.24126)

    - Motivation: Publishing articles in high‐impact English journals is difficult for non‐native English‐speaking scholars
    - Research Gap: uncover the differences in English scientific writing between native English‐speaking scholars (NESs) and NNESs
    - Proposed method:
        - examined the scientific writing styles in English from a two‐fold perspective of linguistic complexity: 
        - (a) syntactic complexity, including measurements of sentence length and sentence complexity; 
        - (b) lexical complexity, including measurements of lexical diversity, lexical density, and lexical sophistication. 
    - Findings: The observations suggest marginal differences between groups in syntactical and lexical complexity.
