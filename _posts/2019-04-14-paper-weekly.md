1. [A decision support framework for robust R&D budget allocation using machine learning and optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923619300569)

    - Motivation: government R&D budget
    - Research question: decision support systems to maximize the total expected R&D output
    - Proposed method:
        - R&D output prediction model
        - robust optimization technique to hedge against uncertainty
