1. [A decision support framework for robust R&D budget allocation using machine learning and optimization](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923619300569)

    - Motivation: government R&D budget
    - Research question: decision support systems to maximize the total expected R&D output
    - Proposed method:
        - R&D output prediction model
        - robust optimization technique to hedge against uncertainty

2. [A multi-objective approach for profit-driven feature selection in credit scoring](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167923619300570)

    - Motivation: feature selection in credit scoring
    - Research gap: standard feature selection only rely on statistical criteria
    - Proposed method:
        - extend the use of profit measures to feature selection 
        - develop a multi-objective wrapper framework based on the NSGA-II genetic algorithm with two fitness functions: the Expected Maximum Profit (EMP) and the number of features.
