Kuppam A, Copperman R, Rossi T, et al. Innovative methods for collecting data and for modeling travel related to special events[J]. Transportation Research Record, 2011, 2246(1): 24-31.

## Motivation

The Maricopa Association of Governments (MAG) is the designated metropolitan planning organization for the Phoenix, Arizona, metropol- itan area. In collaboration with local transit agencies and local jurisdic- tions, MAG developed a successful proposal to compete for FTA Alternatives Analysis Discretionary Program Section 5339 funds. The proposal included development of the special events model and special events data collection. The importance of this task was highlighted by the success of the introduction of light rail transit in the region. The need for better understanding and forecasting of transit markets required in-depth study and modeling of planned special events in the region. Special events patrons constituted a significant portion of light rail rider- ship and overall regional travel demand.
