## What is interpretability?

To interpret means to give or provide the meaning or to explain and present in understandable terms some concepts.

interpretability is defined as the ability to explain or to provide the meaning in understandable terms to a human.

an explanation is an “interface” between humans and a decision maker that is at the same time both an accurate proxy of the decision maker and comprehensible to humans.

Dimensions of interpretability:

- Global and local interpretability
- Time limitation
- Nature of user expertise

an interpretable model can be required either to reveal findings in data that explain the decision, or to explain hwo the black box itself works.

A more applicative nature aimed at explainiing why a certain decision have been returned for a paticular input, or a more theoretical nature aimed at explaining the logic behind the whole obscure model.

## Environment

- General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)

## Why interpretable?

The need for interpretability stems from an incompleteness in the problem formalization, creating a fundamental barrier to optimization and evaluation.

esspecially for downstream task.

- Praticle value. 
    - decision support. 
        - trust and acceptance
        - human understanding
    - accountability
    - safety. unknown mistake. treat cat as dog.
    - industrial liability
- ethical value. 
    - open and transparent
    - data contain human biases and prejudices

## How to evaluate?

- Application-grounded Evaluation: Real humans, real tasks
- Human-grounded Metrics: Real humans, simplified tasks
- Functionally-grounded Evaluation: No humans, proxy tasks

## Explanator

- Decision Tree or Single Tree
- Decision Rules or Rule Based Explanator
- Linear Models or Features Importance
- Saliency Mask
- Sensitivity Analysis
- Partial Dependence Plot
- Prototype Selection
- Activation Maximization

## Interpretable Data for Interpretable Models



## Open the black box problems

- Black box explanation
   - Model explanation
   - Outcome explanation
   - Model inspection
- Transparent box design
