2. [最前线 宝马对华晨宝马持股比例提升至75%，合资车企对半持股时代终结](https://36kr.com/p/5156617.html)

    据彭博社今日报道，德系车企宝马将以36亿欧元收购华晨宝马25%的股份，把在华晨宝马的持股比例提升至75%。这也意味着，宝马将成为中国放宽汽车行业外商来华投资股比限制后的首个受益者，这也意味着中国市场合资车企对半持股时代的终结。

    同日，在沈阳华晨宝马铁西新厂开工仪式上，宝马集团和华晨集团共同宣布，华晨宝马合资协议将延长至2040年，对华晨宝马的投资将新增30亿欧元，用于现有及新增生产设施建设项目，未来3-5年，华晨宝马的年产能预计增加至每年65万台。

    外资车企在中国有更大的作为，主要受益于不断放宽的政策。今年4月18日，发改委就曾表示，通过5年过渡期，汽车行业将全部取消限制。比如，2018年取消专用车、新能源汽车外资股比限制；2020年取消商用车外资股比限制；2022年取消乘用车外资股比限制，同时取消合资企业不超过两家的限制。此次宝马收购华晨宝马股份的交易也正好在2020年完成，也正是赶上了政策限制取消的时间点。

    而在8月底，估值1750亿美元的自动驾驶公司Waymo也在上海成立了子公司，提供自动驾驶汽车部件及产品设计、测试和相关配套服务，这可能会让百度紧张一把。

3. [Uber变身“美团”](https://36kr.com/p/5156680.html)

    过去的一年对于Uber来说充满了戏剧性：2017年6月，创始人Travis Kalanick出局，市值700亿的Uber经历了高管集体出走、内斗、投资人和创始人对簿公堂等混乱的两个月；今年初，软银以450亿美元的估值，向Uber注资12.5亿美元，缓解了Uber的混乱局面，同时也要求Uber将IPO提上日程。

    两年前，Uber 6.8亿美元收购无人驾驶卡车初创企业Otto，随后又成立了新的部门，专门进行无人驾驶卡车的研发。

    去年，谷歌无人驾驶汽车子公司Waymo对Uber提起诉讼，指控Otto的创始人莱万多夫斯基利用偷来的激光雷达技术构建Otto的无人驾驶平台。Uber够倒霉的，又花了2.5亿美元打官司。

    不过，今年七月，Uber宣布停止研发无人驾驶卡车，而是将重点放在无人驾驶汽车上，近10亿美元算是白花了。（据说无人驾驶汽车业务也要出售了）

    今年2月份，优步与沃尔玛合作测试杂货配送，最初，这个合作被视为是亚马逊的强劲对手。但是，仅仅三个月后，合作就被取消了。

    Uber Eats的营业额年增长率为200％，占公司第一季度全球总营业额的13％左右，高于去年年底的10％。但该业务在其近300个市场的大部分市场都处于亏损状态，主要原因是Uber Eats一直在持续扩张，成本居高不下。

    Uber  Freight, the newly spun out Uber business unit, will push out an upgraded app in the coming weeks with better, more intuitive tools to help truck drivers connect with shipping companies.

5. [Coord, a Sidewalk Labs spin-out, raises $5 million to help mobility services better integrate into cities](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/11/coord-a-sidewalk-labs-spin-out-raises-5-million-to-help-mobility-services-better-integrate-into-cities/)

    Coord,  the mobility data startup that spun out of Alphabet-owned Sidewalk Labs, has raised a $5 million Series A round led by Alliance Ventures, with participation from Trucks, Urban.Us and DB Digital Ventures.

    The plan with the funding is to continue to enhance Coord’s APIs and geographic coverage, as well as “build a bridge between the private and public sectors,” Coord co-founder and CEO Stephen Smyth wrote on Medium.

    “Our goal is to help the public and private sectors speak the same language when it comes to urban transportation,” Smyth wrote. “While many private companies are not well integrated into existing transportation systems of today, we believe that end users will ultimately demand interoperability across all of the systems in a city. To that end, we are driving standardization of transportation-related data across cities.”

8. [Self-driving cars could change the way you get around in retirement](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/11/self-driving-cars-could-change-the-way-you-get-around-in-retirement.html)

    At The Villages retirement community in central Florida, there are approximately 125,000 residents and about 750 miles of road.

    And by the end of this year, those streets are slated to have a new service to help its residents — ages 55 and up — get around: a ride-sharing service using self-driving cars.

    Voyage, a venture-backed company, plans to formally launch its ride-hailing service in The Villages, about 57 miles northwest of Orlando, by the end of this year.

    Voyage is currently targeting a $1-per-mile price point for its services. The services currently only run in the retirement villages, which are designed to be one-stop shopping for all your health and entertainment needs.

9. [SO, SELF-DRIVING CARS COULD MAKE HUMANS UNHEALTHIER THAN EVER](https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-cars-obesity-pollution-public-health/)

    A widespread shift to vehicles that drive themselves, some experts say, could weaken humanity’s already slipping stance in a two-front war against pollution and sedentary behavior. They worry that once the stress of traffic and overt dangers of car travel are gone, people will spend more time in their rolling Barcaloungers. And just because cars drive themselves doesn’t mean they’ll all be battery-powered or that they’ll somehow inspire their occupants to get active.

10. [Huawei and Audi partner on 'intelligent self-driving'](https://www.zdnet.com/article/huawei-and-audi-partner-on-intelligent-self-driving/)

    Huawei and Audi have announced that they will partner on intelligent connected vehicles, with the networking giant's Mobile Data Center (MDC) being integrated into the Audi Q7 as a showcase prototype.
