    它在孟买引入了“燃料价格指数”，将司机的收入与该市燃料价格的变化挂钩。Uber表示，这符合司机的“利益”，会使司机每公里的收入增加1卢比。对全职司机而言，估计每月收入将增加2000-2200卢比。

    Uber此举实属无奈。有知情人士称，Ola和Uber的司机们威胁，将从周六开始第二轮罢工，周一还将举行示威。

    后院起火之外，Uber更大的烦恼，则来自它的大金主——沙特公共投资基金（PIF）。

2. [共享单车第一镇的衰落，留下什么反思？](https://36kr.com/p/5162617.html)

    前几年共享单车风口起来之后，天津的王庆坨镇随着风口变得兴旺，但如今共享单车风口过去，这个被称之为共享单车第一镇的地方也被拖垮了。

    有数据显示，这个镇有4万人口，但是有70%的工作是与做自行车相关。短短几年时间，这个镇出现了200多个小作坊。在共享单车火爆时，据政府公开资料显示，在2015年6月的时候，这个小镇光是自行车商铺就有500多家，其中整车企业有160余家，零配件企业有260多家，每年生产的各类自行车，达到1500万辆。

    2016年下半年到2017年，天津作为重点产区接手了60%的订单。该镇工人工资都翻倍涨，当时工人们一个月能挣1万多元，人人看到的是光明的前景与未来。

5. [Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak Doesn’t Believe in Self-Driving Cars](http://www.thedrive.com/news/24921/apple-co-founder-steve-wozniak-doesnt-believe-in-self-driving-cars)

    The major concern Wozniak seems to have about the reality of completely self-driving cars is that roads were built by humans, humans are imperfect, and the cars are currently unable to account for this factor.

    Wozniak himself owns a Tesla, citing that he enjoys driving it, but doesn’t think Autopilot is what people think it is. The root of his skepticism supposedly stems from his experience with his vehicle. He explains that he had upgraded his Tesla before relenting the idea that his car would have the ability to completely self-drive. 

6. [Ford Plans a Self-Driving Service—But Tech Problems Still Loom](http://fortune.com/2018/11/15/ford-self-driving-ride-share-service/)

    Ford is expanding its horizons with plans to launch a self-driving ride-share service in 2021, CNBC reports. It’s a direction that will ultimately clash with the likes of Uber, Lyft, and General Motors (GM), among others.

    And a University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute study found a continuous multi-decade decrease in the percentage of driver’s licenses held by 16- through 44-year-olds, reducing the potential market.

8. [Does Self-Driving Technology Live Up to Its Name?](https://247wallst.com/autos/2018/11/15/does-self-driving-technology-live-up-to-its-name/)

    AAA researchers tested three well-publicized autonomous driving systems to find out how vehicles equipped with today’s partially autonomous systems perform in conditions that are common on public roads.

    AAA director of automotive engineering and industry relations, Greg Brannon, commented:

    Both real-world and closed-course testing exposed separate yet equally serious limitations with these systems. It reinforces that there is still much work to be done to educate consumers on the nuances between system names and functionality and that it is much too early to refer to these vehicle technologies as automated.

    It doesn’t seem like a totally crazy thought, given that 49% of Brits have already had sex in a car, and every teen in America has some sort of ‘makeout point’ car park where they spend their formative years tonguing in a Cadillac.

10. [THIS BRAND HAS BEEN VOTED MOST-TRUSTED FOR SELF-DRIVING CARS](https://www.driving.co.uk/news/brand-voted-trusted-self-driving-cars/)

    DriveTribe asked its community of car enthusiasts, “Whose autonomous cars would you feel safest in?”, and the Swedish car manufacturer stands out well ahead of the competition, despite the likes of Google and Tesla regularly making headlines with their advances in AI car tech.

    Over half (51.1%) of the 2,520 respondents said they’d put their trust in Volvo – a car maker synonymous with safety and reliability.

11. [Watch just a few self-driving cars stop traffic jams](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/11/watch-just-few-self-driving-cars-stop-traffic-jams)

    The researchers used a video game–style interface to control simulated cars on made-up roadways. In one scenario, the cars drove around a figure eight with a central intersection. In others, one or several lanes of traffic merged, or the cars traversed a Manhattan-like city grid with traffic lights at each crossing. The team looked at various ratios of self-driving cars mixed with regular cars that simulated typical human driving.

12. [Ex-Bosch engineers seek to make self-driving cars safer](http://www.autonews.com/article/20181116/COPY01/311169935/bosch-self%20driving-autonomous)

    Apex.AI was founded by Jan Becker and Dejan Pangercic in Palo Alto, Calif. The company publicly unveiled its efforts on Thursday and said it had raised $15.5 million in venture capital funding from Canaan Partners and Lightspeed Venture Partners.

13. [Waymo, MADD partner on drunken-driving message for holidays](https://www.azcentral.com/story/news/local/chandler/2018/11/17/waymo-madd-partner-drunken-driving-message-holidays/2026546002/)

    Google's version of self-driving cars, Waymo, is launching its annual "Tie One On for Safety" campaign in partnership with Mothers Against Drunk Driving and other groups in the Phoenix area for the upcoming holiday season.
