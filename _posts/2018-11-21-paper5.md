## Motivation

In Jeju island, Republic of Korea, the Taxi Telematics system has begun its service of real-time location tracking[1], efficient taxi dispatch, time-saving route finding, and many others. As in the case of other real- time tracking systems, this system needs to trace the current position of each vehicle as accurate as possible[2]. To this end, each taxi, equipped with a GPS (Global Positioning System) receiver and a wireless communication interface, reports its location record to the central call server. The in-vehicle telematics device builds a location record consist of timestamp, longitude, latitude, speed, direction, and status[3]. The status field indicates whether the taxi is
carrying a passenger or empty. The call control server is responsible to keep such reports from each taxi and handles the call request from a customer by finding and dispatching a taxi closest to the call point.

## Proposed method

This paper analyzes a pick-up pattern of taxi service in Jeju area based on the real-life location history data collected from the Taxi Telematics system, aiming at obtaining useful background data necessary to design a location recommendation service for empty taxis.
