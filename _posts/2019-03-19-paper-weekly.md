1. [Transport poverty and subjective wellbeing](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418313806)

    Findings: Transport poverty lowers subjective wellbeing.

    Data: 12 waves of the Household, Income and Labour Dynamics in Australia (HILDA) survey.

2. [MGu T, Kim I, Currie G. Measuring immediate impacts of a new mass transit system on an existing bike-share system in China[J]. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 2019, 124: 20-39.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418305962)

    Findings: Most SPBS ridership and users within the metro’s catchment (the treatment group) have largely increased since the introduction of the M4, while non-commuting cycling increased more than commuting cycling. The exception happens in metros’ hub, where SPBS ridership slightly decreased after M4. As for SPBS trip-pattern, before M4 was introduced, trip-pattern in CBD areas in Gusu District is found to be partially imbalanced (high returning in the morning and high renting in the evening), while balanced pattern (similar returning and renting in morning and evening) is more often seen in other areas. After M4 was introduced, a general trip-pattern change from the balanced to the imbalanced is observed regardless of land use, except for educational land use existing in Wuzhong District. This further indicates that after new metros was introduced, SPBS tends to serve “first-mile” interchange (origins to metros) rather than “last-mile” interchange (metros to destinations) in the morning and vice versa in the evening regardless of land use type. This unique pattern could lead to different policy and management in enhancing interchanging service between BS and mass transit.

    Works: the current decision-making processes in transportation projects do not always explicitly take into account sustainable transportation requirements and often ignore concerns that may arise in other fields such as environmental protection, health, or urban design. The proposed framework in this paper aims at integrating sustainability in a decision-making process by creating better collaboration and communication between professionals of such disparate fields.

    Findings: A customisable solution is the only viable solution to mitigate motion sickness.

6. [Useche S A, Montoro L, Sanmartin J, et al. Healthy but risky: A descriptive study on cyclists’ encouraging and discouraging factors for using bicycles, habits and safety outcomes[J]. Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 2019, 62: 587-598.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1369847818306934)

    Findings: This study addressed encouraging and discouraging factors influencing cyclists’ decision to use the bike. Physical health, environmental sustainability and economy were the main factors encouraging cycling. Perceived crash risk, adverse weather conditions and lack of safety were found to be the most relevant discouraging factors.

    Findings: The profitability of electric taxi drivers is studied empirically under various battery capacity and charging conditions.

    Findings: Social motivations are positively related to intentions to adopt electric vehicles. However, public charging infrastructure is unrelated to intentions to adopt. Policy interventions need targeted at different consumer groups if the aim is to further achieve mass adoption.

    Findings: The results empirically demonstrate the potential of a multitasking propensity to reduce the disutility of travel time.

    Findings: This paper aims at mining spatial–temporal movement patterns from massive taxi trajectory data for discovering the inherent travel flow information within the urban system.

    Findings: The effect of travel mode on travel satisfaction seems partly mediated by attitudes. Travel satisfaction might affect mode choice and attitudes more than vice versa. A model reshaping links between mode choice, attitudes and satisfaction is proposed.

12. [Pérez-Marín A M, Ayuso M, Guillen M. Do young insured drivers slow down after suffering an accident?[J]. Transportation Research Part F: Traffic Psychology and Behaviour, 2019, 62: 690-699.](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1369847818306053)

    Findings: Being involved in an accident significantly reduces a driver’s propensity to speed. However young drivers continue to commit speed violations, albeit to a lesser degree. This outcome is more accentuated among young male drivers. A greater reduction in speeding by drivers that suffer severe bodily injuries is observed.
