    Where does your self-driving car go after it has dropped you off?

    That's the question Adam Millard-Ball set out to answer in his latest research — and the results of his investigation could throw cold water on some of the promised benefits of self-driving cars.

    As the University of California, Santa Cruz environmental studies professor lays out in his research set to publish next month in the Journal of Transportation Policy, autonomous vehicles have three choices when it comes to what to do between rides: park, go home, or circle aimlessly to kill time.

    "In practice, the decisions by AVs regarding parking location and where to park or cruise are likely to be economically driven," the paper says. And the cheapest option is likely to be cruising for more than 40% of trips, Millard-Ball found.

    AVs are even more reason for congestion pricing

    **看法：Journal of Transportation Policy可以关注，AV方便拥堵税征收。**
