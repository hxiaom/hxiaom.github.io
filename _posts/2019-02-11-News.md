3. [Self-driving cars could actually make congestion much worse](https://www.businessinsider.com/self-driving-cars-traffic-worse-research-2019-2)

    Where does your self-driving car go after it has dropped you off?

    That's the question Adam Millard-Ball set out to answer in his latest research — and the results of his investigation could throw cold water on some of the promised benefits of self-driving cars.

    As the University of California, Santa Cruz environmental studies professor lays out in his research set to publish next month in the Journal of Transportation Policy, autonomous vehicles have three choices when it comes to what to do between rides: park, go home, or circle aimlessly to kill time.

    "In practice, the decisions by AVs regarding parking location and where to park or cruise are likely to be economically driven," the paper says. And the cheapest option is likely to be cruising for more than 40% of trips, Millard-Ball found.

    AVs are even more reason for congestion pricing

    **看法：Journal of Transportation Policy可以关注，AV方便拥堵税征收。**

6. [Who's liable when a self-driving car runs you over? Legislative bill attempts to clarify that](https://www.omaha.com/news/legislature/who-s-liable-when-a-self-driving-car-runs-you/article_ce06f4d3-1557-536a-b38c-6eb1eba1e97a.html)

    Legislative Bill 142 is an attempt to not only clarify who is liable, but th standardize that across the nation, based on guidance provided by the U.S. Department of Transportation and the federal Highway Traffic Safety Administration last summer.

    **看法：法律因素需要梳理。或者自己梳理太慢的话，找到梳理的文章也好。**

7. [A second Apple self-driving car engineer is accused of stealing trade secrets](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/01/30/apple-autonomous-vehicle-engineer-accused-of-stealing-trade-secrets.html)

    A recently unsealed affidavit by an FBI agent alleges former Apple engineer Jizhong Chen took confidential and proprietary information about Apple's self-driving project to his personal devices in an attempt to steal trade secrets.

    Another engineer was accused of similar crimes in July.

    Chen claimed he was applying for jobs internally at Apple, but allegedly applied to two external roles, including one at a direct competitor to Apple's self-driving car unit based in China.

    **看法：道德才能走得长远。**

8. [Wall Street is split on self-driving cars](https://www.axios.com/split-views-about-self-driving-cars-on-wall-street-48897a1c-c480-4910-8018-65d91e69bbe6.html)

    The bet on data helps to explain why analysts at Morgan Stanley have very different views on the two leading AV companies.

    Auto analyst Adam Jonas recently reduced the value of GM's self-driving car unit, Cruise Automation, to $9 billion, from $11.5 billion, citing delayed expectations for fully self-driving cars.

    Meanwhile, tech analyst Brian Nowak figures Alphabet's self-driving car unit, Waymo, is worth $37 billion, and perhaps as much as $175 billion, citing future opportunities from robotaxis, logistics and licensing revenues.

    Those same opportunities are available to Cruise, too, but for the moment, GM investors are focused more on the roadblocks ahead.

    Jonas says the massive gap between Cruise and Waymo is realistic because of the advantage Waymo has from Google's superior data analytics capability.

    **看法：华尔街都对自动驾驶的实现时间出现了分歧。这是为什么？他们获取到的信息不一样吗？**
