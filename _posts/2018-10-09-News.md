3. [打开万亿级市场蓝海，「平等车市」要以B2B为切入口做二手车交易平台](https://36kr.com/p/5155687.html)

    随着互联网、新零售的发展，关于 C2C、B2C 的二手车交易在近几年得到了快速发展，瓜子、优信等平台的崛起，也让 C 端的买家和卖家拥有了线上交易的场景。然而，在 B 端交易过程中，还存在许多较为传统的模式。

    36氪近期接触到的「平等车市」，是步古科技旗下二手车商 B2B 交易平台。平等车市希望建立一个平等透明的二手车交易环境，作为交易第三方以公允价帮助车商成交，确保交易平等。

    用户可以通过平台浏览二手车车型信息、报价、保险等，并可在线进行买卖沟通，提升交易效率。此外，平台还为用户提供技术保障服务。

    林哲表示，平等车市希望以帮助车商交易环境变得更透明，通过价格公差定锚的检测标准，公允价为基础的Vickery出价模式（出价最高的投标者获得，但只需按第二高的出价进行购买），达成双方都满意的公平交易，并以到岸交割方式作为物流办证担保，解决车商异地交易的难题，并以只做第三方的原则，让买家车商及卖家车商都能拥有对等的资讯，实现”让公平触手可及”的二手车车商交易平台。

4. [UK Uber drivers to stage 24 hour strike over pay and conditions](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/08/uk-uber-drivers-to-stage-24-hour-strike-over-pay-and-conditions/)

    A UK union that represents the interests of Uber  drivers has called a 24 hour strike for tomorrow.

    Ride-hailing giant Uber may not be comfortable thinking of the people who do the driving on its platform as workers but, in 2016, a UK employment tribunal ruled against its classification of a group of then current and former drivers as independent contractors after they brought a legal challenge; and again in 2017 when Uber lost its first appeal against the tribunal ruling.

    It said Uber drivers are demanding an end to unfair deactivations (described by the union as ‘de facto dismissals’); an increase in fares to £2 per mile (vs the current rate of £1.25p/m in London); a 10% reduction in commissions paid by drivers to Uber (currently 25% for UberX); and calling for Uber to immediately apply the tribunal judgement and implement “employment conditions that respect worker rights for drivers, including the payment of at least the minimum wage and paid holidays”.
