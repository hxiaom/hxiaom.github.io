1. [在硅谷租大仓库研发自动驾驶技术，苹果的下一个硬件会是车吗？](https://36kr.com/p/5159194.html)

    据 AppleInsider 报道，苹果近日在硅谷的米尔皮塔斯城，签下了一个近 31.4 万平方英尺（约 2.92 万平方米）的单层仓库，租期 10 年。开发商 Joey McCarthy 称这块地用于「工业、研发和制造」。

2. [最前线 滴滴做酒店？如果没有顺风车事件，酒旅业务可能已经上线](https://36kr.com/p/5159191.html)

    据《财经》报道，继做外卖之后，滴滴开始考虑孵化新业务，目前其有意探索的是酒店业务。从今年大约9月份开始高层从外卖团队剥了一部分员工出来，让他们到各个酒店做体验，包括连锁酒店和单体酒店，目前该新业务的内部负责人也已经基本确认。

3. [Should Self-Driving Cars Have Ethics?](https://www.npr.org/2018/10/26/660775910/should-self-driving-cars-have-ethics)

    To pose these questions to a large range of people, the researchers built a website called [Moral Machine](http://moralmachine.mit.edu/hl/zh), where anyone could click through the scenarios and say what the car should do. "Help us learn how to make machines moral," a video implores on the site.

    What does this add up to? The paper's authors argue that if we're going to let these vehicles on our streets, their operating systems should take moral preferences into account. "Before we allow our cars to make ethical decisions, we need to have a global conversation to express our preferences to the companies that will design moral algorithms, and to the policymakers that will regulate them," they write.

	Ms Porat said that Waymo had expanded the number of people participating in its “early rider” programme during the third quarter, and is “beginning to test pricing models” in the Phoenix suburbs, where it has been piloting autonomous vehicles since 2016. 

    “We moved into very early days of commercialisation, we do now have people paying for rides,” she told analysts, while adding that the venture was still in the “very early days”. 

	Investors have become increasingly interested in Waymo’s commercial potential, after nearly a decade of development — the business started out as Google’s self-driving car project within its experimental X lab in 2009.

5. [VW, Ford Could Team Up on Self-Driving](https://www.industryweek.com/leadership/vw-ford-could-team-self-driving)

    Talks between Volkswagen AG and Ford Motor Co. on forming an alliance have broadened to include potential collaboration on autonomous driving and arrangements to make vehicles for one another, according to people familiar with the matter.

6. [Self-driving cars bring new risks — and require new regulations](https://www.axios.com/self-driving-cars-bring-new-risks-require-new-regulations-621fa7e9-1828-475d-a8ff-46777b44c108.html)

    Commercial air travel is carefully regulated and the FAA is funded at $17 billion a year, helping to make airline fatalities extremely rare in the U.S. However, the agency in charge of auto safety, NHTSA, has a budget of less than $1 billion and only voluntary guidelines to make sure self-driving cars are safe before they hit the road.

    What’s needed: Consumers deserve strong protections that are missing from the bills before Congress.

    Minimum performance standards for computer perception, cybersecurity and automation-induced driver distraction for partially automated and fully self-driving cars

    Strong privacy rules and sharing of safety data with regulators, investigators and researchers

    Accessibility and safety for all disability communities

    Public information about vehicles' safety, capabilities and limitations

    State and local authority to limit the deployment of AVs until these federal rules are in place
