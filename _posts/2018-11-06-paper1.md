Rong L, Cheng H, Wang J. Taxi Call Prediction for Online Taxicab Platforms[C]//Asia-Pacific Web (APWeb) and Web-Age Information Management (WAIM) Joint Conference on Web and Big Data. Springer, Cham, 2017: 214-224.

## Motivation

The online taxi-calling services have gained great popular- ity in the era of sharing economy. Comparing with the traditional taxi service, the online taxi-calling service is much more convenient and flex- ible for passengers, because the taxi platform can provide detailed travel arrangements, transparent estimated price and flexible means of calling in advance. To understand the call willingness of passengers and to increase the quantity of orders, it is important to predict whether a request will be converted to a call order.

Taxi calling prediction information benefit the platforms in triple ways. 

(i) Evaluating price mechanisms. TCR reflects the willingness of passengers to travel by taxi after the platform adopts new price mechanisms and discount strategies. 

(ii) Expanding potential market. By observing historical data, the platforms can discover times and regions with low TCR, which have room for growth. 

(iii) Customizing individual needs. The platforms can learn passenger behaviors from user historical records, and then choose the most suitable prices and the best travel scheme for users. Therefore, TCP is a foundational issue in large-scale online taxi industries. 

## Research question

we want to predict whether a request will be converted to a call order.

## Review

The taxi demand prediction studies the problem of forecasting the demands in every pick up location, which can further guide and optimize the taxi dispatching [11] and task assignment in location-based services [9,10]. Moreira-Matias et al. [7] design a model to predict the number of future services at a given taxi stand, where the GPS traces and event signals are transformed into a time series of interest as both a learning base and a streaming test framework. Recently, Tong et al. [8] propose a simple unified linear regression approach with massive combi- national features to estimate real-time taxi demands, which successfully uses fea- ture engineering methods to improve the accuracy of the taxi demand prediction. Above works only studied the demand prediction, and there are some research predicting the the supply-demand. Anwar et al. [1] combine the trajectories of taxi and flight arrival data to predict the unmet taxi demands, which means the gap between taxi demands and potential supply of taxicabs at airports. Dong et al. [12] predict the equilibrium of the supply-demand, and use environment data such as the weather or traffic conditions to enhance the prediction accuracy. Both demand prediction and supply-demand prediction are regression problems essentially, they predict the number of taxi demand or demand gap in a period of time at an area, hence it is impossible to extend works on demand prediction to TCP.

## Data Description

The original taxi order records of the Beijing dataset are sampled in proportion from Didi. The Beijing raw dataset contains 23,851,235 original taxi order records from July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016.

## Proposed method

To solve the problem of TCP, we propose a unified TCP framework with some classification models and spatio-temporal features. Figure 1 illustrates the overview of the framework. We first investigate multiple real-world datasets including taxi records and meteorology. Then we extract four types of basic features over time, space, money and meteorology domains to train models as a basic version. And we present an advanced version by generating user person- alized historical features based on the understandings of the business logics of online taxicab platforms.

## Contribution

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first effort on the prob- lem of taxi call prediction for large-scale online taxicab platforms. We transform the overhead of sophisticated model redesign into feature engineering, and apply three state-of-the-arts classification models for training and testing. We con- duct extensive experiments on two real datasets from the largest online taxicab platform in China. The experimental results show that our prediction models perform well.
