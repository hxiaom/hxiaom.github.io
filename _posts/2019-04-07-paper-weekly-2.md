    - Motivation: Daily commuting time increasing
    - Research Gap: how contextual targeting with commuting impacts user redemptions of mobile coupons
    - Method: field study
    - Finding:

        - the redemption rate of commuters is higher for coupons with shorter expiration periods, whereas that of noncommuters is higher for coupons with longer expiration periods.
    - Theory: 
        - stress, which is exacerbated by commuting, increases commuters’ coupon redemption rate. We
