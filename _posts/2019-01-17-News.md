2. [最前线 斑马发布首份驾驶行为报告：90后最守规矩，广东司机越夜越寂寞](https://36kr.com/p/5172601.html)

    1月16日，互联网汽车平台斑马网络发布的《2018驾驶行为报告》（下称《报告》）。

    《报告》显示，70后稳当老司机，擅长急刹车和急转弯，80后喜欢弯道超车，其超车次数最高，在路上也最寂寞，最爱与车机对话；90后司机则是开车最守规矩的，开车急加速次数、急刹车次数、超车次数均低于其他年龄层的6%左右。

    阿里巴巴技术委员会主席王坚曾表示，“进了汽车还用手机，这是汽车人的羞辱”。《报告》发现，超过八成的车主上车后抛弃手机，人均车辆在线48分钟／天，人均在线听歌7首/天，近七成车主每天通过“你好斑马”召唤九大类生态服务，其中一名江苏车主在2018年中呼唤斑马达5537次

    《报告》也还原了车主的地域出行属性——广东人夜间开车爱与车机聊天，其次数高于全国平均45%；上海车主急加速、超车比例高于全国平均150%；重庆“山路十八弯”，高速过弯比例高于全国平均160%；广西人则最佛系，其驾车规范高于全国平均25%。

3. [NVIDIA Resets The Self-Driving Bar Again With AutoPilot Supporting 'Level 2+'](https://www.forbes.com/sites/patrickmoorhead/2019/01/15/nvidia-resets-the-self-driving-bar-again-with-autopilot-supporting-level-2/#49895c673ff2)

     NVIDIA’s first big announcement from the conference was the unveiling of DRIVE AutoPilot, which the company calls “the world’s first commercially available Level 2+ automated driving system,” which I believe is an accurate description. This will likely be very consumer impactful, given DRIVE AutoPilot’s cutting-edge AI technologies will allow supervised self-driving vehicles to go into production in 2020.

    Level 2 today encompasses many of the ADAS systems out there like Volvo’s Pilot Assist and Tesla’s AutoPilot. L2 ADAS systems can control steering, accelerating and braking at the same time but unlike L3, L2 drivers still need to keep their hands on the wheel.  NVIDIA’s AutoPilot is an L2 “+” system. The “plus” enables features like Volvo’s upcoming 360 degree surround perception and driver monitoring systems, both which require deep learning.

    Ford Motor Co. and Volkswagen AG confirmed Tuesday morning,  the two automakers will work together to develop and produce medium-size pickup trucks and small commercial vans. In a joint conference call with reporters and industry financial analysts, Ford President and CEO Jim Hackett called the agreement “the next industry transforming event.” They also revealed plans to cooperate on electric and autonomous vehicles.

    Intel vet Aicha Evans will lead self-driving car startup Zoox from next month, becoming a rare high-profile black chief executive in a Silicon Valley.

    LAS VEGAS — Autonomous truck developer TuSimple said it will expand its U.S. test fleet to 40 vehicles by June, which the company claims will make it the world’s largest self-driving truck business.

    TuSimple, which currently operates 11 tractors in Arizona, also said it will begin hauling freight through New Mexico and into Texas early this year.
