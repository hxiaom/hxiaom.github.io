## 2. Probability Distributions

One limitation of the parametric approach is that it **assumes a specific functional form for the distribution**, which may turn out to be inappropriate for a particular application. An alternative approach is given by **nonparametric** density estimation methods in which the form of the distribution typically depends on the size of the data set. Such models still contain parameters, but these **control the model complexity rather than the form of the distribution**. We end this chapter by considering three nonparametric methods based respectively on histograms, nearest-neighbours, and kernels.
