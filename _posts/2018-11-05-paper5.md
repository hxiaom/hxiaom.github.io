## Motivation

Human mobility patterns reflect many aspects of life, from the global spread of infectious diseases to urban planning and daily commute patterns. In recent years, the prevalence of positioning methods and technologies, such as the global positioning system, cellular radio tower geo-positioning, and WiFi positioning systems, has driven efforts to collect human mobility data and to mine patterns of interest within these data in order to promote the development of location-based services and applications. 

The efforts to mine significant patterns within large-scale, high-dimensional mobility data have solicited use of advanced analysis techniques, usually based on machine learning methods, and therefore, in this paper, we surveyand assess different approaches and models that analyze and learn human mobility patterns using mainly machine learning methods. 

We categorize these approaches and models in a taxonomy based on their positioning characteristics, the scale of analysis, the properties of the modeling approach, and the class of applications they can serve. 

We find that these applications can be categorized into three classes: user modeling, place modeling, and trajectory modeling, each class with its characteristics. Finally, we analyze the short-term trends and future challenges of human mobility analysis.

## Review

Mobility data have been used to answer questions such as how people travel between cities [73]and what the patterns are of their daily commute [37, 80], as well as to predict socioeconomic trends [33], find relationships in online social networks [21], identify people’s weight and health status [65], discover employment patterns [28], and follow the spread of infectious diseases [5, 93].

Mobility data were also found to represent human behavior in catastrophic events, e.g., the 2010 Haiti earthquake [9, 57] or the 2011 Japan earthquake [31].

Models of mobility were used in designing public transportation systems [11], in taxicab allocation [43], and in performing crowd-sourcing tasks [76]. In addition, the analysis of mobility patterns leads to a growing field of commercial applications by mobile communication service providers such as Telefonica1 and Verizon,2 as well as by several companies that have already started to pro- vide location-based services analyzing mobile phone location traces. 

## 2. Background: human mobility patterns

The first efforts to learn human mobility patterns were associated with classic social sci- ences. Since the nineteenth century, sociologists in what are called time-use or time-budget studies have been measuring the time people spend doing different activities throughout the day [85].

### 3.1 Application class

User modeling applications analyze the mobility of a single user (or object) for extended periods of time (Fig. 1a). In such applications, the model can predict where a particular user will be at different times of the day. For example, in homeland security applications, targeted users can be modeled by the distribution of their geographic locations over time in order to trigger an alarm if an abnormal situation occurs.

Place modeling applications analyze the characteristics of a geographic location or a set of locations. For example, in Fig. 1b, the model can predict the number of incoming and outgoing people in a place (say a large store), profile its traffic, and classify the type of place according to the mobility patterns of people around it.

Trajectory modeling applications analyze a set of spatial–temporal points that reflect a trajectory, defined as a movement pattern through a set of locations of a single object or a set of objects and time. In contrast to user modeling, in trajectory modeling, the identities of the moving objects are not necessarily a factor in the analysis; thus, for example, all the moving objects along the modeled trajectory can be analyzed aggregately. In contrast to place modeling, the entity in trajectory modeling is a route between geographic locations, rather than a single location. For example, Fig. 1c visualizes a trajectory that may be used in modeling road segments or road networks by an application that predicts traffic conditions.

## 4 Application classes of human mobility patterns

### 4.1 User modeling

User modeling can also be used to categorize and cluster locations and other properties of individual users, as well as to predict themobility ofusers or clusters ofusers. 

### 4.2 Place modeling

Methods addressing place modeling can be divided into several categories, based on the way spatial environments are defined and organized. Traditional studies of place modeling rely on specialized spatial databases that describe the underlying world map (using vector graphics representation) and define the topology and relations among different vector objects (points, lines, polygons). Typically, place modeling represents a location in its physical form using geographic coordinates or other local coordinate systems, enabling what is usually called spatial data mining (SDM) [66]. SDM is mostly used in domains such as climatology, earth science, public health, and demographic analysis in which human mobility traces augment geographic models, providing insights into how humans use the space.

Figure 5 exemplifies possible levels of place modeling. In individual place modeling (Fig. 5a), the analysis process uses location traces to identify the places users stay in [4]. The definition of a place in most research relates to a specific location or a polygon that the user remained for a meaningful period of time. In the second level of modeling (Fig. 5b), a place is modeled statistically based on visitation patterns of users in this place [15]. Semantic place modeling (Fig. 5c) analyzes the semantic properties of places, such as “residential” or “commercial” [104]. Finally, activity-based place modeling (Fig. 5d) provides semantic annotation that individuals give to a place they visit according to their activity in this place, such as “studying” or “shopping” [49].

The first level of individual place modeling requires abstraction of the physical location data. Without abstraction, the continuous, high precision location data do not allow a simple extraction ofmobility patterns. Some high-level analysis relies on straightforward geographic definitions, such as of countries, states, cities, and neighborhoods. For example, Krings et al. [45] provided a statistical analysis of the relationships between cities, modeling people’s movement between cities using a gravity function. A more detailed abstraction is often the partitioning of the geographic space into (uniquely) labeled segments so the location of waypoints falling within a segment can be replaced with the segment label [63]. While partitioning is an abstraction, it retains the essential spatial attributes (aswell as shortcomings) of the physical locations. For example, two waypoints that are very far apart will generally be assigned different labels even if both fit the same semantic label (e.g., two restaurants).

In statistical place modeling, information about people’s visits to a particular place is accumulated and analyzed using statistical tools such as regression and distribution plots. Reades et al. [73] divided Rome into even-sized areas of 250,000 square meters and described each area according to distinct patterns of visitation. While the method portrays the dynamic of a city through a large-scale data analysis, the fact that the analysis was done for an arbitrary division of the urban environment limits the type of knowledge that can be derived from such analysis. In contrast, studies such as Krishnamachari et al. [46] and Xiao et al. [94] investigated how knowledge about human mobility can be used to divide urban areas into meaningful sub-areas, finding that dividing areas into even sizes (polygons of cells) is less effective than dynamic area allocation based on users’ mobility. Other studies focused on finding significant places from mobility analysis using clustering methods [1, 38].

Semantic place modeling provides a higher level ofabstraction and, like semantics in other fields, abstracts different geographic granularities of a place. For example, several waypoints located in a classroom on a university campus might be labeled “Room No. 438,” “Engineer- ing Building,” or “University Campus.” These labels represent different categorizations of places according to some predefined semantics. Yan et al. [95] suggest using hidden Markov models to infer the semantic labels ofa place, where the hidden states represent the categories ofthose places. Zhu et al. [104] used several methods, e.g., L1-norm logistic regression, SVM, gradient boosted trees, and random forest to attach semantic labels to places.

Finally, place modeling can be based on user activity that is carried out in a certain place. Then, two persons in the same place, say a class, a teacher and a student, will label this place differently, e.g. “Work” and “School,” respectively [49]. Zaslavsky et al. [97]present a framework that gathers data from many sensors, including low-level wearable sensors, to label activities in different granularities.
