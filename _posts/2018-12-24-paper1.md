Yeoh B S A, Huang S. Introduction: fluidity and friction in talent migration[J]. Journal of Ethnic and Migration Studies, 2011, 37(5): 681-690.

## Research work

We draw out two key themes that inform the arguments advanced by the papers in this special issue. 

First, instead of hyper-fluid global nomads who move effortlessly across frictionless global space, the papers show that moving and belonging are not simply motivated by economic logic but are folded into broader social, cultural and political considerations and conditioned by the power geometries ofrace, nationality and gender. 

Second, different groups of talent migrants are attracted to and positioned differently in specific spaces of encounter within cities, generating a politics of identity that influences everyday life. 

Taken together, these two themes highlight the need to avoid artificially bifurcating the lives of talent migrants into the economic and social/cultural spheres, and instead to argue for interweaving them within the same frame in understanding the mobility of the highly skilled.

### The Cultural Politics of Moving and Belonging

### The Cultural Politics of Place and Identity

## Useful information

In more recent times, however, the emerging scholarship on highly skilled economic migrants has attempted to move beyond assumptions of hyper-mobility and cosmopolitan sophistication to portray them as embodied bearers of culture, ethnicity, class or gender. 

A second related move in the emerging literature is to counter earlier assumptions that transnational elites are perpetually ‘rootless merchant sojourners’ (Cheah 2001: 135), ‘cosmopolitans’ who are ‘basically indifferent to where they lived’,or ‘cosmopolites’ who are ‘habitants of a vast universe’ (Robbins 1998: 3);
