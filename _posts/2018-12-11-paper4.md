Van Hage W R, Malaisé V, Segers R, et al. Design and use of the Simple Event Model (SEM)[J]. Web Semantics: Science, Services and Agents on the World Wide Web, 2011, 9(2): 128-136.

## Motivation

Events have become central elements in the representation of data from domains such as history, cultural heritage, multimedia and geography.

## Proposed method

The Simple Event Model (SEM) is created to model events in these various domains, without making assumptions about the domain-specific vocabularies used. SEM is designed with a minimum of semantic commitment to guarantee maximal interoperability. In this paper, we discuss the general requirements of an event model for Web data and give examples from two use cases: historic events and events in the maritime safety and security domain. The advantages and disad- vantages of several existing event models are discussed in the context of the historic example. We discuss the design decisions underlying SEM. SEM is coupled with a Prolog API that enables users to create instances of events without going into the details of the implementation of the model. By a tight coupling to existing Prolog packages, the API facilitates easy integration of event instances to Linked Open Data. We illustrate use of the API with examples from the maritime domain.
