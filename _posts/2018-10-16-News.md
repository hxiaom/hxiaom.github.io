    据《南华早报》报道，特斯拉已在香港设立了拥有50个充电桩的大型充电站，这是亚洲同类充电站中规模最大的一个。尽管香港政府已经取消了慷慨的减税政策，导致其汽车销量大幅下滑，但特斯拉仍寻求扩大在香港的业务。

    特斯拉宣布，将在九龙湾FT Life Tower开设新的充电站，它将是特斯拉在亚洲最大的公共充电站点。

    与大楼的房东(也拥有特斯拉豪华轿车)合作，这栋两层楼的停车场（总面积4564平方米）现在安装了50个特斯拉墙面连接器，每小时充电高达7千瓦。

    这个停车场有122个停车位，所有车辆每小时的停车费为港币28元(约合3.59美元)，电动汽车不另外收费。今年7月份，特斯拉的第一个超级充电站在半山区启用，它可以在75分钟内为特斯拉充满电。

    目前，特斯拉在香港的21个超级充电站中有92个超级充电桩，超过400个公共和共享充电桩。特斯拉一位发言人表示，该公司将继续在香港增加充电站，寻求与私人开发商建立更多合作关系，并计划明年开设更多新的充电站。

    自去年4月1日起，电动汽车首次登记税的豁免上限为9.75万港元，促使电动汽车销量大幅下滑。从2017年4月到今年3月，新登记的电动汽车只有136辆，而去年同期为5819辆。

    在香港拥有200名员工的特斯拉销售业绩受到的冲击最大。从去年4月到今年2月，它只卖出了40辆汽车。而在2017年3月一个月，它就售出2939辆。

4. [嘀嗒宋中杰：未来专注做出租车、顺风车，一定不会做快车、专车](https://36kr.com/p/5157209.html)

    据不完全统计，到今天，手机叫车大概占到了30%，打出租车的需求（包括网约车出租车）只占了70%。未来我想会倒过来，70%的用户会用手机叫车，路上扬招的可能不足30%。

    “份子钱”体制发展到现在，其弊端越来越明显，这点是否需要改变？大家都觉得需要，但我们有没有这个能力、有没有管理水平去改变这个事情。过去行业规模比较分散，基本在这个行业里没有出现大的企业，发展到现在，工业化、信息化，在这种业态之下，特别是网约车企业的发展，越来越证明这个行业是需要有规模的，如果规模不够，效率其实是偏低的，你没办法在现有市场中竞争。

    我想这些都是面临的挑战和问题。但我们出租车行业是否没有希望了？我不这么认为。传统出租车行业有很大规模的稳定运力，将近140万有牌照的出租车，260万的司机群体，一年360多亿的服务次数，相当于一天一亿次，而且过去也在管理上形成了相对来说出租车更加安全的属性，何况我们的司机群体都是老司机，认识路、驾驶技术安全，这一系列因素，都是传统巡游出租车的优势。从主管部门领导、从业企业和司机以及嘀嗒这样的出行平台，相信如果我们携手，还是有机会把这个行业做得更好，实现复兴。

    区域性平台和全国性平台，在获客和留客成本上差异是巨大的。很多人跟我们探讨商业模式，问我们怎样持续发展、怎样有商业模式？我们会收一些服务费，但总体来说很少，我们只能靠业务本身的衍生业务，比如，以后我们可以给在座各位提供汽车融租赁的金融服务，可以把车体作为广告平台，收取广告费，扩大营收。但大家想一想，一个城市如果只有2000辆出租车，基本没有广告价值，20000辆的价值可能也不大，但如果全国有150万辆，那就会形成一个可观的广告市场价值平台。所以从一个平台可持续发展的角度来看，这无疑也是一个全国性平台才能承担的。

    刚才我们说到，全国性网约化平台，1亿次/天，我们的评估可能是6000万/天，但网上来单不足5%，也就是说，网约化程度是很低的。很多平台把出租车网约化作为边缘化产品或补充性产品，这样的定位，是承担不了整个出租车行业网约化任务的，基于现状，嘀嗒定位自己就是不做专车、快车，专注于打造一个只有巡游出租车的网约化平台，在此，我们郑重承诺，嘀嗒出行绝不做专车、快车，我们只做巡游出租车的网约化平台。

    Anger at Uber has been sparked by the reaction of CEO Dara Khosrowshahi  to the disappearance of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, who has not been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 for a pre-arranged appointment to obtain documentation for his forthcoming marriage to a Turkish citizen.

    Grin, an electric scooter startup backed by Y Combinator, has raised a $45.7 million Series A to operate shared, electric scooters in Latin America.

8. [Not everyone is ready to ride as autonomous vehicles take to the road in ever-increasing numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/self-driving-cars-take-to-the-road-but-not-everyone-is-ready-to-ride.html)

    Hundreds of self-driving vehicles are now plying U.S. roadways, and the numbers could climb into the thousands, perhaps even the hundreds of thousands, now that the U.S. Department of Transportation has updated guidelines, easing federal oversight in a bid to encourage automakers and tech companies like Aurora and Alphabet's Waymo to speed up development.

    Just a week earlier, the House of Representatives, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, passed its version of the SELF DRIVE Act, which could result in as many as 100,000 self-driving cars taking to the road by 2021 or 2022, depending on how soon the Senate moves on its version of the bill.

    And that may prove more difficult than the industry might hope — a potentially serious problem considering that, by various estimates, spending on autonomous technology will run as high as $100 billion over the coming decade.

    A study released at the beginning of the year by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that by the end of the next decade, fully 20 to 25 percent of the miles that Americans travel by car will be logged by fully driverless vehicles operated by ride-sharing services such as Waymo, Uber, Lyft and GM's Maven.

    there's a deep distrust of the technology, with more than four out of 10 Americans saying they "would never ride" in a fully automated vehicle, according to a new study conducted in partnership by research firm J.D. Power and Associates and the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, or NAMIC.

    The study found fully 15 percent of the American public "don't believe there will ever be an autonomous vehicle on the market, and 42 percent said they would never ride in a fully automated vehicle," according to Robert Lajdziak, a senior J.D. Power researcher and analyst.

9. [Dubai launches its self-driving taxi service](https://mashable.com/article/dubai-rta-self-driving-taxi-cars/#WfG2dDLXfiqN)

    The cars are intended to connect passengers during the "first and last mile" to get from existing transportation systems to, say, a shopping mall or movie theater or other venue or to get back home. 

    The RTA said the cars go up about 20 mph and fit four passengers. Up front is a safety driver who can take over the car if needed. In promotional materials the cars are depicted without anyone in the front seat for a truly driverless experience, hinting at what the transportation agency could introduce later. The cars are modified Mercedes-Benz sedans with cameras, sensors, and LiDAR system built into the car.

    French car maker Peugeot doesn't think the future of self-driving cars has to look like sci-fi-inspired pods. 

    Instead, a design executive said this week he thinks car design could even be pleasant and alluring, since "there’s a danger the future might be very robotic and might lack soul."

    It can easily empower the cars to detect other cars, people or even detect hazards that are three times farther as compared to the current color cameras that are used in the cars. Moreover, these cameras can be mass-produced at the cost as low as $10 per piece.

12. [Rand study shows it's hard to gauge self-driving car safety](http://www.autonews.com/article/20181015/MOBILITY/181019703/autonomous-vehicle-safety-measurements)

    "The meaning of safety in regard to AVs is surprisingly unclear -- no standard definition exists," says the nonprofit think tank's study issued last week. The study, "Measuring Automated Vehicle Safety", was sponsored by Uber.

    Rand's findings suggest common ground is needed to build trust among government officials and members of the public alike as an automated-driving age approaches. Further, the study is critical of the secretive nature of vehicle development.

    Rather than wait to deploy self-driving vehicles until statistics can prove they're safer than human-driven vehicles -- and risk missing out on their benefits in the interim -- Rand says industry leaders, academics and policymakers should develop leading indicators that are essentially measures correlated to positive safety outcomes instead of waiting for crashes to happen and counting them.

    Rand introduced the idea of "roadmanship" as a potential measure for the competence of self-driving systems. Instead of counting crashes or disengagements, a system could measure events correlated with safety outcomes, such as whether a vehicle's actions would have violated a traffic law.

    Rand suggests data stemming from crashes and unexpected events be shared with crash investigators, government officials and academics. That's not happening now.

    South Korean megasupplier Hyundai Mobis Co. is shifting into a higher gear to develop autonomous drive technologies. To help catch up with European and North American competitors, Mobis has launched a proving ground with an artificial city for self-driving vehicles. 

15. [NVIDIA Hyperion: At Last a Self Driving Car Kit in a Box](https://techspective.net/2018/10/14/nvidia-hyperion-at-last-a-self-driving-car-kit-in-a-box/)

    At the heart of the NVIDIA Hyperion Kit is the Drive AGX DevKit which is the brains of the solution. This is basically a small supercomputer with multiple 8-core “Carmel” CPUs, a Deep Learning Accelerator, a Volta-class GPU, programmable vision accelerator, stereo and optical flow engine, an image signal processor and video encoder/decoder. The kit adds to this 7 external and 1 internal camera (for driver monitoring), 8 radars, and an optional Lidar component. This provides a comprehensive vision package that should perform in all reasonable weather and light situations and—since the NVIDIA solution is fully trained—provide a near plug-and-play experience once the solution is properly installed and introduced to the car.

    Other than installing the computer and sensors, assuring the car has the necessary control infrastructure for self-driving is also necessary—suggesting cars that currently use computer-aided breaking and drive-by-wire systems would be the easiest to upgrade.

    Eventually I think this progression will result in an NVIDIA car, not for sale to consumers, but as a rolling kit that will allow those that are still late at the end of the decade to catch up.

16. [Here's How Tesla Autonomous Driving Could Lead to Self-Delivering Cars](https://www.inverse.com/article/49847-tesla-here-s-how-autonomous-driving-could-lead-to-self-delivering-cars)

    The CEO promised back in October 2016 that cars built from that point on would offer coast-to-coast autonomous drives as early as the end of 2017. That deadline came and went, but Musk announced in August a new A.I. chip to power the feature, plus the prospect of autonomous drives in an alpha version of the next software update. While this is going on, Musk has said that Tesla now finds itself in a “delivery logistics hell.” Randy Ofiara, vice president of enterprise sales for BlueGrace Logistics, doesn’t think it’s that unreasonable to say that a car could deliver itself in theory very soon.

    First, a quick primer. Cars are currently delivered through a sort of hub-and-spoke model. The cars are loaded from a factory to a delivery point like a train, which delivers them thousands of miles to stations where they’re loaded onto car carriers before making their way to consumers. These stations can serve areas of a radius somewhere around 100 to 250 miles. This is the model used by around 70 percent of vehicles sold in the United States.

    In Ofiara’s vision, autonomous cars will first cut out the journey from hub to hub, perhaps by following a segregated lane on an interstate highway. 

    This seems like a small change, but it could solve a major problem in the delivery industry: there aren’t enough drivers. Ofiara explains that the commercial trucking industry competes with manufacturing and construction for labor. Potential drivers are faced with the prospect of a long time away from home, unsociable hours, poor working conditions and little benefit. Compare it with the life of, say, a builder, and it’s easy to see why the trucking industry has a hard time attracting new recruits.
