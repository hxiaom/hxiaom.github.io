1. [最前线 Uber断臂印度外卖业务，IPO前要止损开源](https://36kr.com/p/5180450.html)

    Uber计划将Uber Eats在印度的外卖业务出售给对手Swiggy，目前双方协商正在进行。此次交易以股权交换的形式进行，Uber将获得其10%的股份，交易或将在接下来的几周完成。对此消息，Swiggy和Uber暂不予回应。

    外卖业务在印度是个吃力不讨好的业务。主要体现在订单数市场份额远低于对手，投入回报比不高两方面。

    2018年，UberEats共覆盖了印度37个城市，月均订单数为900万。此次的收购商，Swiggy则覆盖80个城市，订单数为2000万左右。被称为“印度版大众点评”的Zomato的城市数为150个，链接80,000家餐厅，月均订单量为1400万。

    据印度《经济时报》，Uber某高管消息称，其印度外卖业务每月成交的900万订单中，公司需投入 2500 万美元。值得注意的是，Uber在印度的外卖并不设起送价，每单业务中仅抽取0.23美元的利润，在同等价位下，比英国所收取的30%佣金低得多。

    **Uber的战略是什么？有必要死磕吗？当年Uber退出中国的选择对吗？**

    Tesla  CEO Elon Musk has until March 11 to explain why he should not be held in contempt for violating a settlement agreement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

    **解释之后，股价会有波动，我想是上涨。**

    In its final weeks as a private company, Lyft  is reaching for every inch of the rideshare market it can get.

    According to a report from The Information, Lyft’s discounts were extended to roughly one-third of riders’ recent trips and helped Lyft gather an additional 4 percent of the U.S. rideshare market. Lyft now holds 34 percent of the market, while Uber claims the remaining 66 percent. The additional percentage points will give Lyft a leg up as it launches its road show, the final step ahead of its Nasdaq IPO, expected in April.

    Devoted Uber riders may have noticed discounts, too. The competing ride-hailing giant also unleashed a hefty dose of discounts to keep riders on its app. Uber, of course, is also in IPO registration, expected to debut on the public markets in the first half of 2019, likely one or two months after Lyft.

    **Lyft占美国34%市场，估值200亿，准备3月份上市；Uber占美国66%市场，估值1000亿，准备上半年上市。Lyft上市之后会涨还是跌？**

4. [Report says VW to invest $1.7 billion in Ford self-driving unit Argo](https://electrek.co/2019/02/26/vw-ford-argo-investment/)

    Volkswagen will invest around $1.7 billion in Ford’s self-driving subsidiary Argo, according to a new report.

    It’s unclear at this point how this proposed partnership would affect Volkswagen’s partnership with self-driving startup Aurora, which was announced in January 2018. Volkswagen reportedly tried to buy Aurora outright later in 2018, but was rebuffed.

    Aurora recently announced that it secured $530 million in financing from the likes of Amazon, Sequoia, and others. It appears Volkswagen may now be considering a different self-driving route.

    **等到十年后回顾这段历史，肯定是波澜曲折。**
