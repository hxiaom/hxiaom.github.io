## 1. Introduction

The field of pattern recognition is concerned with the **automatic disvery of regularities in data** through the use of computer algorithms and with the sue of these regularities to take actions such as classifying the data into different categories.

**training set** is used to tune the parameters of an adaptive model.

**target vector t**, which represents the identity of the corresponding digit.

The result of running the machine learning algorithm **can be expressed as a function y(x)** which takes a new digit image x as input and that generates an output vector y, encoded in the same way as target vectors.

The precise form of the function y(x) is determined during the training phase, also known as the **learning phase**, on the basis of the training data.

Once the model is trained it can then determine the identity of new digit images, which are said to comprise a **test set**.

The ability to categorize correctly new examples that differ from those used for training is known as **generalization**. generalization is a **central goal** in pattern recognition.

For most practical applications, the original input variables are typically preprocessed to transform them into some new space of variables where, it is hoped, the pattern recognition problem will be easier to solve. This **pre-processing stage is sometimes also called feature extraction**. Note that new test data must be pre-proessed using the same steps as the training data.

Pre-processing might also be performed in order to **speed up computation**. The aim is to find useful features that are fast to compute, and yet that also preserve useful discriminatory information. Because the number of such features is smaller than the number of pixels, this kind of pre-processing represents a form of **dimensionality reduction**. Care must be taken during pre-processing because often information is discarded, and if this information is important to the solution of the problem then the overall accuracy of the system can suffer.

Applications in which the training data comprises examples of the input vectors along with their corresponding target vectors are known as **supervised learning** problems. Cases such as the digit recognition example, in which the aim is to assign each input vector to one of a finite number of discrete categories, are called **classification** problems. If the desired output consists of one or more continuous variables, then the task is called **regression**.

In other pattern recognition problems, the training data consists of a set of input vector x without any corresponding target values. The goal in such **unsupervised learning** problems may be to discover groups of similar examples within the data, where it is called **clustering**, or to determine the distribution of data within the input space, known as **density estimation**, or to project the data from a high-dimensional space down to two or three dimensions for the purpose of **visualization**.

Finally, the technique of **reinforcement learning** (Sutton and Barto, 1998) is concerned with the problem of finding suitable actions to take in a given situation in order to maximize a reward. Here the learning algorithm is not given examples of optimal outputs, in contrast to supervised learning, but must instead discover them by **a process of trial and error**. A major challenge of reinforcement learning is **credit assignment problem**. A general feature of reinforcement learning is the **trade-off between exploration and exploitation**.

three important tools that will be used throughout the book, namely **probability theory, decision theory, and information theory**.

### 1.1 Example: Polynomial Curve Fitting
 
 individual observations are corrupted by random noise. This **noise** might arise from **intrinsically stochastic (i.e. random)** processes such as radioactive decay but more typically is due to **there being source of variability that are themselves unobserved**.

 **Probability theory**, discussed in Section 1.2, probides a framework for expressing such uncertainty in a precise and quantitative manner, and **decision theory**, discussed in Section 1.5, allows us to expoit this probabilistic representation in order to make predictions that are optimal according to appropriate criteria.

 **Model comparison** or **model selection**

 the reason of over-fitting is becoming **increasingly tuned to the random noise on the target values**.

 the over-fitting problem become **less severe as the data set increases**. Another way to say this is that **the larger the data set, the more complex (in other words more flexible) the model that we can afford to fit to the data.**

 One rough heuristic that is sometimes advocated is that **the number of data points should be no less than some multiple (say 5 or 10) of the number of adaptive parameters in the model**. However,as we shall see in Chapter 3, the number of parameters is not necessarily the **most appropriate measure of model complexity**.

 Also, there is something rather unsatisfying about having to limit the number of parameters in a model according to **the size of the available training set**. It would seem more reasonable to choose the complexity of the model according to **the complexity of the problem being solved**.

 We shall see that the least squares approach to finding the model parameters represents a specific case of maximum likelihood (discussed in Section 1.2.5), and that the over-fitting problem can be understood as a general property of maximum likelihood. **By adopting a Bayesian approach, the over-fitting problem can be avoided**. We shall see that there is no difficulty from a Bayesian perspective in employing models for which the number of parameters greatly exceeds the number of data points. Indeed, in a Bayesian model the effective number of parameters adapts automatically to the size of the data set.

 One technique that is often used to control the over-fitting phenomenon in such cases is that of **regularization**, which involves adding a **penalty term** to the error function in order to discourage the coefficients from reaching large values. Techniques such as this are known in the statistics literature as **shrinkage methods** because they reduce the value of the coefficients. The particular case of a quadratic regularizer is called **ridge regression**. In the context of neural networks, this approach is known as **weight decay**.

 Note that often the coefficient w_0 is omitted from the regularizer because its inclusion causes the results to depend on the choice of origin for the target variable, or it may be included but with its own regularization coefficient.

 Here we simply note that, if we were trying to solve a practical application using this approach of minimizing an error function, we would have to find a way to determine a **suitable value for the model complexity**. The results above suggest a simple way of achieving this, namely by taking the avaliable data and partitioning it into a training set, used to determine the coefificients w, and a separate **validation set**, also called a **hold-out set**, used to optimize the model complexity (either M or lamda). In many cases, however, this will prove to be too wasteful of valuable training data, and we have to seek more sophisticated approaches.


### 1.2 Probability Theory

 A **key concept** in the field of pattern recognition is that of **uncertainty**. It arises both through **noise on measurements**, as well as through the **finite size of data sets**.

 Probability theory provides a consistent framework for the **quantification** and **manipulation** of **uncertainty** and forms one of the central foundations for pattern recognition.

 When combined with **decision theory**, it allows us to make **optimal predictions** given all the information available to us, even though that information may be **incomplete** or **ambiguous**.

 **Random variable**. This random variable can take some **possible values**

 two elementary rules of probability, known as **sum rule** and the **product rule**.

 **conditional probability**

 **Bayes' theorem**

 **joint distribution**

 **marginal distribution** and **conditional distribution**

 We can provide an important interpretation of Bayes' theorem as follows. If we had been asked which box had been chosen before being told the identity of the selected item of fruit, then the most complete information we have available is provided by the probability p(B). We call this the **prior probability** because it is the probability available **before** we observe the identity of the fruit. Once we are told that the fruit is an orange, we can then use Bayes' theorem to compute the probability p(B\|F), which we shall call the **posterior probability** because it is the probability obtained **after** we have observed F.

#### 1.2.1 Probability densities

 **measure theory**

#### 1.2.2 Expectations and covariances

 One of the most important operations involving probabilities is that of finding **weighted averages of functions**. The average value of some function f(x) under a probability distribution p(x) is called the **expectation** of f(x) and will be denoted by E[f].

**continuous variables**

**probability density**

**conditional expectation**

**variance**

**covariance**

#### 1.2.3 Bayesian probabilities

So far in this chapter, we have viewed probabilities in terms of **the frequencies of random**, **repeatable events**. We shall refer to this as the **classical** or **frequentist** interpretation of probability. Now we turn to the more general Bayesian view, in which probabilities provide a **quantification of unceratinty**.

Bayes' theorem was used to convert a prior probability into a posterior probability by incorporating the evidence provided by the observed data.

We would like to be able to **quantify our expression of uncertainty** and make precise revisions of uncertainty in the light of new evidence, as well as subsequently to be able to take optimal actions or decisions as a consequence. This can all be achieved through the elegant, and very general, **Bayesian interpretation of probability.**

we would like to address and quantify the uncertainty that surrounds the appropriate choice for the model parameters w. We shall see that, from a Bayesian perspective, we can use the machinery of probability theory to describe the uncertainty in model parameters such as w, or indeed in the choice of model itself.

we can adopt a similar approach when making inferences about quantities such as the parameters w in the **polynomial curve fitting example**. We capture our assumptions about w, before observing the data, in the form of a **prior probability distribution p(w)**. The effect of the **observed data D = {t_1, ..., t_N}** is expressed through the **conditional probability p(D\|w)**, and we shall see later, in Section 1.2.5, how this can be represented explicitly. Bayes' theorem, which takes the form p(w\|D) = p(D\|w)p(w)/p(D). Then allows us to evaluate the uncertainty in w after we have observed D in the form of the posterior probability p(w\|D).

The quantity p(D\|w) on the right-hand side of Bayes' theorem is evaluated for the observed data set D and can be viewed as **a function of the parameter vector w**, in which case it is called the **likelihood function**. It expresses **how probable the observed data set is for different settings of the parameter vector w.** Note that the likelihood is **not a probability distribution** over w, and its integral with respect to **w does not (necessarily) equal one.**

Given this definition of likelihood, we can state Bayes' theorem in words: **posterior = likelihood * prior**
