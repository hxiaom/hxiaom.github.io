title: 【Paper】Collaborative Location and Activity Recommendations with GPS History Data
categories: Mobility

## Motivation

With the increasing popularity of location-based services, such as tour guide and location-based social network, we now have accumulated many location data on the Web.

Our research is highlighted in the following location-related queries in our daily life: 

1) if we want to do something such as sightseeing or food-hunting in a large city such as Beijing, where should we go? 

2) If we have already visited some places such as the Bird’s Nest building in Beijing’s Olympic park, what else can we do there? 

In general, the first question corresponds to location recommendation given some activity query (where “activity” can refer to various human behaviors such as food-hunting, shopping, watching movies/shows, enjoying sports/exercises, tourism, etc.), and the second question corresponds to activity recommendation given some location query.

We show to put both location recommendation and activity recommendation together in our knowledge mining, since locations and activities are closely related in nature. 

it is not easy to obtain such a complete location-activity matrix for location and activity recommendations from the raw GPS data due to the following reasons: 

1) the ratings in such a location-activity matrix are not easy to get from the raw GPS data with merely location coordinates and timestamps. Recall that a rating in the matrix denotes how often an activity is performed in a location, so we may need to know what each user did on that location to get a rating.

2) Based on the previous reason, we can only get a very sparse location-activity matrix (e.g. in our dataset, we have less than 0.6% entries with non-missing values), so it is difficult to do recommendations with such limited information.

## Proposed method

### Stay Region Extraction

### Location-Activity Information Extraction

### Location-Feature Extraction

### Activity-Activity Correlation Extraction

### COLLABORATIVE LOCATION AND ACTIVITY RECOMMENDATIONS

## Contribution

We put forward a new problem for collaborative location and activity recommendations based on the GPS history data, so that we can provide more specific recommendations with location or activity constraints.

We propose to exploit location features and activity-activity correlations for collaborative filtering, so as to address the data sparsity problem of the GPS histories. We also show how to well incorporate this additional information with the incomplete location-activity matrix in a collective matrix factorization model for final recommendations.

We evaluate our system using a large GPS dataset, which was collected by 162 users over a period of 2.5 year in the real world. The number of GPS points is around 4 million and its total distance was over 139,310 kilometers.
