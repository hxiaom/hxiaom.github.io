1. [阿里再次加码汽车后市场，智能洗车「驿公里」获 B 轮独家战略投资](https://36kr.com/p/5167406.html)

    驿公里成立于2014年，于2017年8月正式推出智能洗车机器人，用户可通过手机APP扫码，在“极速洗车”、“普通洗车”、“水蜡洗车”三种模式中任选一种，将车辆停入洗车机指定位置，洗完后支付费用，三种模式的洗车时长分别为3分钟、5分钟、7分钟，对应价格为10元、12元和15元。

    谈及为何选择智能洗车这个赛道，驿公里CEO施恒之告诉36氪，目前国内一辆车平均每月清洗4次，洗车已经成为千亿级规模的市场。同时，智能洗车机器人可以解决传统洗车行业的几个痛点：

    第一，价格高，目前各大城市传统人工洗车价格基本在30-35元不等，个别地区甚至达到45元以上，而随着人力成本增加，传统人工洗车服务单价必然上升；第二，传统人工洗车始终没有出现一家独大的全国性洗车品牌，主要是因为其服务工人不可标准化复制；第三，传统洗车店历来存在污水排放问题，污染环境且影响市容。

    As it stands, opposition of the bill revolves around a purported lack of safety measures included in the draft, with supporters claiming this legislation could save lives, and that it would finally conquer a heap of regulatory obstacles that were created for human-driven vehicles in the first place. The push-and-pull between these two sides have created a kind of stalemate which, according to Thune, won’t be resolved before Congress adjourns.

3. [Worries about overlapping map technology used by councils and driverless cars](https://www.stuff.co.nz/technology/109261518/worries-about-overlapping-map-technology-used-by-councils-and-driverless-cars)

    The first was that if there was "a whole bunch of LiDAR systems working in the same area", it could create "sweet spots", where all the low-powered lasers could add up to something which could hurt or damage someone's eyes.

    "This could be so rare that, practically speaking, it'll never happen, or it could be a legitimate worry."

    The other worry is if there were lots of self-driving vehicles in the future, a council's surveying laser could "[hit] the car's sensors" and possibly cause the car sensor to fail. There were also questions about the environmental sustainability of the driverless cars, Ralph said.

4. [5G: a revolution not without risks](https://www.france24.com/en/20181216-5g-revolution-not-without-risks)

    With 5G, transmission speeds should accelerate sufficiently to allow for self-driving cars to take to the roads or for doctors to conduct operations remotely.

    The first reason is that more data and more types of data will be travelling across 5G networks. Much of the data transmitted by sensors could be sensitive, such as information about manufacturing processes that business rivals would be interested in acquiring. Or the data from our homes that could be gleaned to determine all sorts of things about us. The treasure chest of data for hackers is getting much, much bigger.

    A second reason is that an increased reliance on the mobile network means its disruption would have even more serious consequences, both in terms of safety and economic activity. A failure during a remotely guided operation could lead to the death of a patient or a crash of a self-driving car. A longer outage could disrupt an economy. This poses national security risks.
