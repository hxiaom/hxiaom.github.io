Harper C D, Hendrickson C T, Mangones S, et al. Estimating potential increases in travel with autonomous vehicles for the non-driving, elderly and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions[J]. Transportation research part C: emerging technologies, 2016, 72: 1-9.

## Motivation

Automated vehicles represent a technology that promises to increase mobility for many groups, including the senior population (those over age 65) but also for non-drivers and people with medical conditions.

## Research goal

The objective of this paper is to estimate bounds on the impact of a fully automated vehicle environment based on VMT by the current U.S population 19 and older due to new demand from currently underserved populations.

this paper is only concerned with changes in the travel patterns of the elderly, non-driving populations, and those with a travel restrictive medical condition relative to current conditions.

## Data

The primary source of data for this project is the 2009 National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS), which provides information on current travel characteristics of the U.S. population (USDOT, 2011). 

National Household Transportation Survey (NHTS)

The U.S. Department of Transportation (USDOT) periodically releases information on the travel and transportation char-
acteristics of the United States by conducting a representative nationwide survey, in order to assist policymakers and trans- portation planners in quantifying travel behavior and analyzing changes in travel characteristics over time. The 2009 National Household Travel Survey is the most recent national survey and contains significantly more data than any previous survey in the NHTS series, which allows for an expanded assessment of the travel behaviors in the United States. Specifically, the 2009 NHTS dataset contains a large sample size of 150,147 households for the U.S. Along with any household informa- tion, the 2009 NHTS dataset also includes person, vehicle and daily (travel day) trip level data.

## Method

This paper estimates bounds on the potential increases in travel in a fully automated vehicle environment due to an increase in mobility from the non-driving and senior populations and people with travel-restrictive medical conditions.

Demand wedge 1: Non-drivers 19 and older will begin to travel as much as the drivers within each age group and gender. 

Demand wedge 2: Elderly drivers without any travel-restrictive medical condition in the youngest elderly cohort (65–74) will begin to travel as much as working age adults (19–64) within each gender. While, elderly drivers without any med- ical condition in the middle (75–84) and oldest elderly (85+) cohort will travel as much as a person 65 years of age within each gender.

Demand wedge 3: Working age adult drivers (19–64) with a medical condition that makes it hard to travel will begin to travel as much as working age adults without medical conditions in each gender. Elderly drivers with travel restrictive medical conditions in the youngest elderly cohort (65–74) will begin to travel as much as working age adults (19–64) within each gender. Elderly drivers with a medical condition in the middle (75–84) and oldest elderly (85+) cohort will travel as much as a person 65 years of age within each gender.
