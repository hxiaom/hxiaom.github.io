    BEIJING, Dec. 27 (Xinhua) -- Chinese lawmakers have suggested that the country's legislation take into consideration possible tort liabilities raised by self-driving vehicles, to resolve future disputes.

    Wang Yanmeng, a member of the National People's Congress (NPC) Standing Committee, said at a panel deliberation on a draft section on torts of China's civil code Wednesday that the draft should plan for defining liabilities in traffic accidents caused by self-driving cars.

    "Given the rapid development of relevant technologies and the market, autonomous cars may hit the streets in the very near future, rendering the existing stipulations on traffic accident torts obsolete," Wang said.

    Zhou Guangquan, vice chairman of the NPC Constitution and Law Committee, said the legislation needed to respond to the rapid progress of smart society and artificial intelligence.

    Ma Zhiwu, another NPC Standing Committee member, agreed that study and legislation was needed in advance.

    Also at the deliberation, lawmakers suggested more detailed and careful definition of punitive damages for environmental infringement cases, and making law enforcement and procuratorial agencies eligible to demand damages to better deter violations.

    Other suggestions at the deliberation included proper consideration of torts on the Internet environment.
