1. [Road tests of self-driving vehicles: Affective and cognitive pathways in acceptance formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418307183)

    - Motivation: autonomous vehicles
    - Research gap: the pathways (affective vs. cognitive) that guide peopleâ€™s acceptance of road tests (ART) for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and behavioral intention (BI) to use SDVs
    - Findings: two behavioral responses (i.e., ART and BI) based on the trust heuristic and affect heuristic.

2. [Does scientist immigration harm US science? An examination of the knowledge spillover channel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733319300113)

    - Motivation: scientist immigration
    - Research gaps: The recruitment of foreign-trained scientists enhances US science through an expanded workforce but could also cause harm by displacing better connected domestically-trained scientists, thereby reducing localized knowledge spillovers.
    - Findings: we do not find evidence that foreign-trained scientists harm US science by crowding out better-connected domestically-trained scientists, measured by citations by the US scientific community to their publications.

3. [International research collaboration: Novelty, conventionality, and atypicality in knowledge recombination](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733319300046)

    - Motivation: International research collaboration
    - Research gaps: this article tests for novelty and conventionality in international research collaboration.
    - Findings: 
        - Scholars have found that coauthored articles are more novel and have suggested that diverse groups have a greater chance of producing creative work. 
        - international collaboration appears to produce less novel and more conventional knowledge combinations. 
        - Higher citations to international work may be explained by an audience effect.

4. [Research joint ventures and technological proximity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733319300058)

    - Motivation: Research joint ventures
    - Research gap: knowledge spillovers increase with the technological proximity between firms.
    - Findings: 
        - (i) RJVs do not generally outperform competitive research with respect to innovative output and social welfare; 
        - (ii) technological proximity and the intensity of collaboration play a decisive role for the private and social benefits of a RJV;
        - (iii) joint research combined with complete knowledge sharing does not generally outperform less intensive collaboration forms.

5. [Enriched LDA (ELDA): Combination of latent Dirichlet allocation with word co-occurrence analysis for aspect extraction]

    - Motivation: Aspect extraction
    - Research gap: Current aspect extraction techniques are mostly based on topic models; however, employing only topic models causes incoherent aspects to be generated. 
    - Proposed method: this paper aims to discover more precise aspects by incorporating co-occurrence relations as prior domain knowledge into the Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) topic model.

6. [TelCoVis: Visual Exploration of Co-occurrence in Urban Human Mobility Based on Telco Data](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/7192730)

    - Motivation: co-occurrence in urban human mobility
    - Research gap: widespread use of mobile phone, lack of systematic and efficient methods to analysis
    - Proposed method: TelCoVis, an interactive visual analytics system, which helps analysts leverage their domain knowledge to gain insight into the co-occurrence in urban human mobility based on telco data.
