1. [Road tests of self-driving vehicles: Affective and cognitive pathways in acceptance formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418307183)

    - Motivation: autonomous vehicles
    - Research gap: the pathways (affective vs. cognitive) that guide peopleâ€™s acceptance of road tests (ART) for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and behavioral intention (BI) to use SDVs
    - Findings: two behavioral responses (i.e., ART and BI) based on the trust heuristic and affect heuristic.

2. [Does scientist immigration harm US science? An examination of the knowledge spillover channel](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048733319300113)

    - Motivation: scientist immigration
    - Research gaps: The recruitment of foreign-trained scientists enhances US science through an expanded workforce but could also cause harm by displacing better connected domestically-trained scientists, thereby reducing localized knowledge spillovers.
    - Findings: we do not find evidence that foreign-trained scientists harm US science by crowding out better-connected domestically-trained scientists, measured by citations by the US scientific community to their publications.
