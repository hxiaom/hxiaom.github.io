1. [A Waymo employee reveals what it's like to create the unique voice of self-driving cars](https://www.businessinsider.com/waymo-employee-explains-how-self-driving-cars-get-voice-2019-2)

    Imagine that you're sitting in a Waymo One self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivan in the Phoenix area, enjoying your autonomously piloted ride, when the vehicle makes a turn you didn't expect.

    This is nothing new for anyone who has ever hailed a taxi. In New York, where I work, if a cabbie takes a route I disagree with, I can immediately start a conversation about why we should go my way. And for now, Waymo One has human monitors at the wheel.

    But the company's plan is to transition to a fully driverless service. No one behind the wheel. Instead, a screen for passengers to use for interactions with the technology.

    "We started to think to think about how we would communicate how we could interact better with people," Knox said. "We knew that we had to have components of a customer support organization."

    The way it works is that if an issue arises in a Waymo vehicle, assuming there is no human driver, a passenger would press a button in the vehicle to connect with an agent. (Currently, passenger concerns expressed to the human monitoring the system in the driver's seat can be referred to the Rider Support team.)

    **一个39人的团队，负责关注Waymo运行过程中的乘客的顾虑。Waymo one确实是进入商业运营测试阶段。这种运营是把自动驾驶当作出行方式来寻找问题，而不是仅关注软硬件问题在哪。在这种“新出行”中，乘客有什么顾虑（出行费用多少？时间多快？走哪条路？自动驾驶系统是否关注到了环境的情况？），如何与乘客交互（显示屏，语音等）。突然想到，也许在玻璃上框出环境的情况是自动驾驶很好的交互，被框出的行人，说明自动驾驶系统理解了这个行人的情况。**

    "There are several ways that automated vehicles can reduce congestion, but the main one is that it would allow cars to safely travel more closely together," he will say in a speech to the Cities Symposium in western Sydney.
