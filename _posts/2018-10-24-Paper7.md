categories: Mobility

## Motivation

The aim of this work is to recognize the next set of research challenges required to be addressed for achieving highly reliable, fail-safe, intelligent vehicles which can earn the trust of humans who would ultimately purchase and use these vehicles.

## Research question

This paper follows three main domains where humans and
highly automated or self-driving vehicles interact (illustrated in Fig. 1): 

（1) Humans in vehicle cabin

（2) Humans around the vehicle

（3) Humans in surrounding vehicles

## LOOKING AT HUMANS IN AND AROUND THE VEHICLE: RESEARCH LANDSCAPE AND ACCOMPLISHMENTS

1. Domain clustering: humans inside the vehicle, around, and in surrounding ve- hicles.
2. Research goal clustering: prediction (what will happen next?), attention model (where and what is the focus of the agent?), skill and style (what type of agent?), alertness and distraction (what is the state of the agent?), and general activity classification and behavior analysis (how is the agent operating?). autonomy handover and privacy-related tasks.
3. Cue type analysis: direct human-observing cues (e.g. body pose) and indirect cues (e.g. vehicle dynamics, GPS).

Emerging research topics for studying humans inside the vehicle:

    (a) Gaze zone classification using head cues;

    (b) Object interaction analysis and secondary task classification with hand cues;

    (c) Head, hand, and eye cue integration for secondary task activity analysis;

    (d) Cabin occupant activity and interaction analysis.

Emerging research topics for studying people around the vehicle.

    (a) Pedestrian body pose and attribute classification;

    (b) Pedestrian path and intent prediction;

    (c) Fine-grained pedestrain activity classification;

    (d) Social relationships modeling.

Understanding activity and modeling intent of other vehicles
is widely researched for path prediction and activity classification.

## NATURALISTIC DATASETS AND ANALYSIS TOOLS

### A. Towards Privacy Protecting Safety Systems

Privacy preserving considerations may play a role in the con- struction of publicly available large-scale datasets, especially as current state-of-the-art algorithms for intelligent vehicles re- quire large amounts of data for training and evaluation. There- fore, as a community, it is important to raise the standards ofboth safety and security in the development on intelligent vehicles.

### B. Naturalistic Driving Datasets
