3. [George F. Will: How to heal our epidemic of loneliness?](https://www.sltrib.com/opinion/commentary/2018/10/14/george-f-will-how-heal/)

    The public health problem is loneliness. Sasse’s new book argues that Americans are richer, more informed and “connected” than ever — and unhappier, more isolated and less fulfilled.

    America’s largest job category is “driver” and, with self-driving vehicles coming, two-thirds of such jobs could disappear in a decade.

3. [特斯拉在香港建新充电站，规模位居亚洲之首](https://36kr.com/p/5157090.html)

    据《南华早报》报道，特斯拉已在香港设立了拥有50个充电桩的大型充电站，这是亚洲同类充电站中规模最大的一个。尽管香港政府已经取消了慷慨的减税政策，导致其汽车销量大幅下滑，但特斯拉仍寻求扩大在香港的业务。

    特斯拉宣布，将在九龙湾FT Life Tower开设新的充电站，它将是特斯拉在亚洲最大的公共充电站点。

    与大楼的房东(也拥有特斯拉豪华轿车)合作，这栋两层楼的停车场（总面积4564平方米）现在安装了50个特斯拉墙面连接器，每小时充电高达7千瓦。

    这个停车场有122个停车位，所有车辆每小时的停车费为港币28元(约合3.59美元)，电动汽车不另外收费。今年7月份，特斯拉的第一个超级充电站在半山区启用，它可以在75分钟内为特斯拉充满电。

    目前，特斯拉在香港的21个超级充电站中有92个超级充电桩，超过400个公共和共享充电桩。特斯拉一位发言人表示，该公司将继续在香港增加充电站，寻求与私人开发商建立更多合作关系，并计划明年开设更多新的充电站。

    自去年4月1日起，电动汽车首次登记税的豁免上限为9.75万港元，促使电动汽车销量大幅下滑。从2017年4月到今年3月，新登记的电动汽车只有136辆，而去年同期为5819辆。

    在香港拥有200名员工的特斯拉销售业绩受到的冲击最大。从去年4月到今年2月，它只卖出了40辆汽车。而在2017年3月一个月，它就售出2939辆。

4. [嘀嗒宋中杰：未来专注做出租车、顺风车，一定不会做快车、专车](https://36kr.com/p/5157209.html)

    据不完全统计，到今天，手机叫车大概占到了30%，打出租车的需求（包括网约车出租车）只占了70%。未来我想会倒过来，70%的用户会用手机叫车，路上扬招的可能不足30%。

    “份子钱”体制发展到现在，其弊端越来越明显，这点是否需要改变？大家都觉得需要，但我们有没有这个能力、有没有管理水平去改变这个事情。过去行业规模比较分散，基本在这个行业里没有出现大的企业，发展到现在，工业化、信息化，在这种业态之下，特别是网约车企业的发展，越来越证明这个行业是需要有规模的，如果规模不够，效率其实是偏低的，你没办法在现有市场中竞争。

    我想这些都是面临的挑战和问题。但我们出租车行业是否没有希望了？我不这么认为。传统出租车行业有很大规模的稳定运力，将近140万有牌照的出租车，260万的司机群体，一年360多亿的服务次数，相当于一天一亿次，而且过去也在管理上形成了相对来说出租车更加安全的属性，何况我们的司机群体都是老司机，认识路、驾驶技术安全，这一系列因素，都是传统巡游出租车的优势。从主管部门领导、从业企业和司机以及嘀嗒这样的出行平台，相信如果我们携手，还是有机会把这个行业做得更好，实现复兴。

    区域性平台和全国性平台，在获客和留客成本上差异是巨大的。很多人跟我们探讨商业模式，问我们怎样持续发展、怎样有商业模式？我们会收一些服务费，但总体来说很少，我们只能靠业务本身的衍生业务，比如，以后我们可以给在座各位提供汽车融租赁的金融服务，可以把车体作为广告平台，收取广告费，扩大营收。但大家想一想，一个城市如果只有2000辆出租车，基本没有广告价值，20000辆的价值可能也不大，但如果全国有150万辆，那就会形成一个可观的广告市场价值平台。所以从一个平台可持续发展的角度来看，这无疑也是一个全国性平台才能承担的。

    刚才我们说到，全国性网约化平台，1亿次/天，我们的评估可能是6000万/天，但网上来单不足5%，也就是说，网约化程度是很低的。很多平台把出租车网约化作为边缘化产品或补充性产品，这样的定位，是承担不了整个出租车行业网约化任务的，基于现状，嘀嗒定位自己就是不做专车、快车，专注于打造一个只有巡游出租车的网约化平台，在此，我们郑重承诺，嘀嗒出行绝不做专车、快车，我们只做巡游出租车的网约化平台。

    Anger at Uber has been sparked by the reaction of CEO Dara Khosrowshahi  to the disappearance of Saudi journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, a U.S. resident, who has not been seen since entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2 for a pre-arranged appointment to obtain documentation for his forthcoming marriage to a Turkish citizen.

7. [Electric scooter startup Grin raises ~$45 million](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/15/electric-scooter-startup-grin-raises-45-million/)

    Grin, an electric scooter startup backed by Y Combinator, has raised a $45.7 million Series A to operate shared, electric scooters in Latin America.

8. [Not everyone is ready to ride as autonomous vehicles take to the road in ever-increasing numbers](https://www.cnbc.com/2018/10/14/self-driving-cars-take-to-the-road-but-not-everyone-is-ready-to-ride.html)

    Hundreds of self-driving vehicles are now plying U.S. roadways, and the numbers could climb into the thousands, perhaps even the hundreds of thousands, now that the U.S. Department of Transportation has updated guidelines, easing federal oversight in a bid to encourage automakers and tech companies like Aurora and Alphabet's Waymo to speed up development.

    Just a week earlier, the House of Representatives, in a rare moment of bipartisanship, passed its version of the SELF DRIVE Act, which could result in as many as 100,000 self-driving cars taking to the road by 2021 or 2022, depending on how soon the Senate moves on its version of the bill.

    And that may prove more difficult than the industry might hope — a potentially serious problem considering that, by various estimates, spending on autonomous technology will run as high as $100 billion over the coming decade.

    A study released at the beginning of the year by the Boston Consulting Group estimated that by the end of the next decade, fully 20 to 25 percent of the miles that Americans travel by car will be logged by fully driverless vehicles operated by ride-sharing services such as Waymo, Uber, Lyft and GM's Maven.

    there's a deep distrust of the technology, with more than four out of 10 Americans saying they "would never ride" in a fully automated vehicle, according to a new study conducted in partnership by research firm J.D. Power and Associates and the National Association of Mutual Insurance Companies, or NAMIC.

    The study found fully 15 percent of the American public "don't believe there will ever be an autonomous vehicle on the market, and 42 percent said they would never ride in a fully automated vehicle," according to Robert Lajdziak, a senior J.D. Power researcher and analyst.

9. [Dubai launches its self-driving taxi service](https://mashable.com/article/dubai-rta-self-driving-taxi-cars/#WfG2dDLXfiqN)

    The cars are intended to connect passengers during the "first and last mile" to get from existing transportation systems to, say, a shopping mall or movie theater or other venue or to get back home. 

    The RTA said the cars go up about 20 mph and fit four passengers. Up front is a safety driver who can take over the car if needed. In promotional materials the cars are depicted without anyone in the front seat for a truly driverless experience, hinting at what the transportation agency could introduce later. The cars are modified Mercedes-Benz sedans with cameras, sensors, and LiDAR system built into the car.

10. [Futuristic autonomous cars don't have to 'lack soul,' Peugeot designer says](https://mashable.com/article/peugeot-e-legend-autonomous-concept-car/#VCZwTIB4AiqE)

    French car maker Peugeot doesn't think the future of self-driving cars has to look like sci-fi-inspired pods. 

    Instead, a design executive said this week he thinks car design could even be pleasant and alluring, since "there’s a danger the future might be very robotic and might lack soul."

11. [Mantis Shrimp-Inspired Camera Lets Self-driving Cars See in Dangerous Conditions](https://interestingengineering.com/mantis-shrimp-inspired-camera-helps-self-driving-cars-in-dangerous-conditions)

    It can easily empower the cars to detect other cars, people or even detect hazards that are three times farther as compared to the current color cameras that are used in the cars. Moreover, these cameras can be mass-produced at the cost as low as $10 per piece.

12. [Rand study shows it's hard to gauge self-driving car safety](http://www.autonews.com/article/20181015/MOBILITY/181019703/autonomous-vehicle-safety-measurements)

    "The meaning of safety in regard to AVs is surprisingly unclear -- no standard definition exists," says the nonprofit think tank's study issued last week. The study, "Measuring Automated Vehicle Safety", was sponsored by Uber.

    Rand's findings suggest common ground is needed to build trust among government officials and members of the public alike as an automated-driving age approaches. Further, the study is critical of the secretive nature of vehicle development.

    Rather than wait to deploy self-driving vehicles until statistics can prove they're safer than human-driven vehicles -- and risk missing out on their benefits in the interim -- Rand says industry leaders, academics and policymakers should develop leading indicators that are essentially measures correlated to positive safety outcomes instead of waiting for crashes to happen and counting them.

    Rand introduced the idea of "roadmanship" as a potential measure for the competence of self-driving systems. Instead of counting crashes or disengagements, a system could measure events correlated with safety outcomes, such as whether a vehicle's actions would have violated a traffic law.

    Rand suggests data stemming from crashes and unexpected events be shared with crash investigators, government officials and academics. That's not happening now.

    South Korean megasupplier Hyundai Mobis Co. is shifting into a higher gear to develop autonomous drive technologies. To help catch up with European and North American competitors, Mobis has launched a proving ground with an artificial city for self-driving vehicles. 

15. [NVIDIA Hyperion: At Last a Self Driving Car Kit in a Box](https://techspective.net/2018/10/14/nvidia-hyperion-at-last-a-self-driving-car-kit-in-a-box/)

    At the heart of the NVIDIA Hyperion Kit is the Drive AGX DevKit which is the brains of the solution. This is basically a small supercomputer with multiple 8-core “Carmel” CPUs, a Deep Learning Accelerator, a Volta-class GPU, programmable vision accelerator, stereo and optical flow engine, an image signal processor and video encoder/decoder. The kit adds to this 7 external and 1 internal camera (for driver monitoring), 8 radars, and an optional Lidar component. This provides a comprehensive vision package that should perform in all reasonable weather and light situations and—since the NVIDIA solution is fully trained—provide a near plug-and-play experience once the solution is properly installed and introduced to the car.

    Other than installing the computer and sensors, assuring the car has the necessary control infrastructure for self-driving is also necessary—suggesting cars that currently use computer-aided breaking and drive-by-wire systems would be the easiest to upgrade.

    Eventually I think this progression will result in an NVIDIA car, not for sale to consumers, but as a rolling kit that will allow those that are still late at the end of the decade to catch up.

16. [Here's How Tesla Autonomous Driving Could Lead to Self-Delivering Cars](https://www.inverse.com/article/49847-tesla-here-s-how-autonomous-driving-could-lead-to-self-delivering-cars)

    The CEO promised back in October 2016 that cars built from that point on would offer coast-to-coast autonomous drives as early as the end of 2017. That deadline came and went, but Musk announced in August a new A.I. chip to power the feature, plus the prospect of autonomous drives in an alpha version of the next software update. While this is going on, Musk has said that Tesla now finds itself in a “delivery logistics hell.” Randy Ofiara, vice president of enterprise sales for BlueGrace Logistics, doesn’t think it’s that unreasonable to say that a car could deliver itself in theory very soon.

    First, a quick primer. Cars are currently delivered through a sort of hub-and-spoke model. The cars are loaded from a factory to a delivery point like a train, which delivers them thousands of miles to stations where they’re loaded onto car carriers before making their way to consumers. These stations can serve areas of a radius somewhere around 100 to 250 miles. This is the model used by around 70 percent of vehicles sold in the United States.

    In Ofiara’s vision, autonomous cars will first cut out the journey from hub to hub, perhaps by following a segregated lane on an interstate highway. 

    This seems like a small change, but it could solve a major problem in the delivery industry: there aren’t enough drivers. Ofiara explains that the commercial trucking industry competes with manufacturing and construction for labor. Potential drivers are faced with the prospect of a long time away from home, unsociable hours, poor working conditions and little benefit. Compare it with the life of, say, a builder, and it’s easy to see why the trucking industry has a hard time attracting new recruits.

1. [走，投资新机场去](https://www.huxiu.com/article/267130.html)

    呼和浩特市的新机场正在尝试向民间资本开放。
    
    这是一个预算总投资为210亿元的民航项目，按照目前的规划，呼和浩特新机场在建成后将成为国内重要的干线机场、区域性枢纽机场。如果民资能够顺利进入，也意味着呼和浩特新机场将成为中国第一个有民资参与的枢纽性民用客运运输机场。

    民航系统正在以一种前所未有的力度吸引民资：在8月中旬，民航局披露了一份鼓励民间投资的项目清单，其中即包括11家已确定民间投资方的项目和17个向民间资本推介的项目——呼和浩特新机场项目是其中一例——预计总投资规模达到1100亿元；在9月27日，一次民航领域鼓励民间投资推介会于北京再次举办，“鼓励民间投资是新时代民航高质量发展的必然要求。”在这次推介会上，中国民用航空局局长冯正霖表示。

2. [Uber上市估值或达1200亿美元，两倍于滴滴当前估值](https://36kr.com/p/5157427.html)

    据华尔街日报消息，两家华尔街投行对Uber明年初的IPO估值高达1200亿美元。知情人士说，高盛和摩根士丹利上月向Uber提交了估值方案。这些文件通常就如何将股票配置给潜在投资者提供建议，是银行被正式聘用为IPO承销业务之前的常见步骤。

    就1200亿美元的估值而言，几乎是两个月前Uber融资中估值的两倍。作为对比，是当前滴滴估值的两倍之多——550亿美元。而要少于全球最大的独角兽，蚂蚁金服的估值——1500亿美元。

    今年5月23日，香港经济日报报道，滴滴最快下半年启动上市，已初步决定落户香港，并考虑不同上市架构，不排除以同股不同权形式上市。当时，滴滴估值约550亿美元。预计滴滴最终上市时，市值或能达700亿-800亿美元。不过，随着滴滴的持续整改，以及顺风车业务的无限期下线，当前的估值可能已经有所缩水。

    今年二季度数据显示，Uber的交易额120亿美元，同比增长了41%；营收27亿美元，同比上涨了51%；亏损额为6.59亿美元，而第一季度的亏损额为5.77亿美元。9月5日，消息人士向36氪独家透露，滴滴2018年上半年净亏损高达40.4亿元人民币，其中绝大部分为乘客司机补贴和司机奖励。华尔街见闻曾报道，滴滴2017年整体亏损3-4亿美元。这也意味着，其2018年10亿盈利目标落空。

3. [车好多完成1.62亿美元C+轮融资， 与人人车的汽车新零售之战已经开启](https://36kr.com/p/5157406.html)

    二手车新一轮的竞争开启，这次瞄准的是线下的汽车新零售。

    10月16日，车好多集团正式宣布完成1.62亿美元C+轮融资，以及昆山市提供给毛豆总部基地30亿元人民币的资金支持。新加入的投资方包括天图投资等，而DST、诺伟其、CKE作为老股东追加投资。此轮融资后车好多集团估值达66亿美元。

    据车好多介绍，本轮融资及资金将重点用于发展新零售，包含全国线下店布局——瓜子二手车严选直卖店、毛豆新车直营店，以及围绕新零售在大数据、人工智能、智能设备等技术层面的投入。到2018年底，瓜子二手车严选直卖店将在全国100个城市开设100家线下店，总面积将超过130万平方米；毛豆新车将在全国200个城市开设300家直营线下店，深度覆盖三线及以下城市。

4. [新商业NEO100 专访姚劲波：行业冷静了我们才加码二手车，与杨浩涌做混战盟军](https://36kr.com/p/5157039.html)

    在姚劲波看来，每隔大公司都需要一些能够逆周期的业务，换句话说，当其他主要业务都做得不好的时候，这个业务已经能够给你带来盈利增长。对于58来说，二手车正是这样的存在。

    他笃定这是一个巨大的市场，等待着自己去收割。58的二手车业务在最近的广告中也喊出“二手车就要白菜价”，根据公司内部观测到的数据，3到8万的成交价格才符合现在的二手车市场，而其用户基本遍布了二三四线城市的普通大众。

    姚劲波：其实58一贯不说先发制人，我们更喜欢后发先制，在特别准的时间点介入。我们判断到2019到2020年二手车市场会进入高速发展期。因为几年前中国新车销售超过2000万辆，那些车到今天都可能变成需要流通的二手车，而且中国已经连续很多年超过美国的新车销量，所以毫无疑问中国也会成为超过美国的第一大二手车市场。比如说前年做二手车，你对应的可能是中国卖几百万台车的时候，到了今天这个时点再往后2019年、2020年可能对应的是2000万辆体量，也许会经历一个比较大的增长阶段。

    姚劲波：58同城有很大的数据库，我们观察到二手车流通概率最大的是三到五年的车，而三到五年前，恰恰是中国新车开始销量爆发的时候。

    姚劲波：这是我们比较特别的一点，就是58同城二手车业务上其实主要专注于3万到8万的二手车交易，这也是我们区分和其他平台的个标准。因为我们发现大部分人买二手车其实都会关注价格，如果他真的不在乎价格他就省事直接买新车了。

    姚劲波：我们这里服务都是中小车商，群体特别分散，过去没人服务他们。你看汽车之家过去都服务大品牌，大4S店，但是我们不在乎，58同城就是做累活出身的，所以这些对我们并不是什么障碍，从而可以很好地管理这个体系。中小车商缺乏信用，过去也没人给他们做担保，但是在58同城上买车的人都是信赖58的。如果（一辆车）打上标志说58检测过它，它的状况如何，估多少分，平台担保是真实的车辆，还能查到它的维修记录，我甚至说如果你再付几百块钱，我就给你上一年的延保，出问题我来修，你可以找我，不是找这个小车商，那这辆车就具备一定的安全性了。

5. [Uber and Lyft are responsible for about half of SF’s rise in traffic since 2010, SFCTA says](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/uber-and-lyft-are-responsible-for-about-half-of-sfs-rise-in-traffic-since-2010-sfcta-says/)

    While ride-hailing services increase congestion throughout the entire city, there are concentrated effects in certain districts. Take District 6, which includes the tech company-heavy SOMA neighborhood, where ride-hailing services account for 45 percent of the increased delay while employment change accounts for 36 percent of the increased delay. But in District 3, which includes tourist-heavy areas like The Embarcadero and North Beach, Uber and Lyft account for 73 percent of increased delays.

    “One thing that has really been sorely absent is that we have remained largely in the realm of the hypothesis” in terms of why there’s been such an increase in traffic in the city, said Joe Castiglione, the study’s co-author and SFCTA Deputy Director for Technology, Data and Analysis. “We’re seeking to ground this in a real data-driven and rigorous analytic approach to answering this question.”

    “We’re silent on policy prescriptions,” Castiglione said. “We’re trying to peel the onion a bit more but we’re not going to lay on policy recommendations. We’re trying to give people some insight into what happens. Ultimately, our board, they’re the policymakers.”

6. [Lyft’s $299 subscription plan is launching to the masses](https://techcrunch.com/2018/10/16/lyfts-subscription-plan-is-now-available-to-the-masses/)

    Lyft  has been testing versions of an all-access monthly subscription plan since March. Now, it’s ready to make it available to everyone in the U.S. 

    Starting today, U.S.-based riders can sign up for the plan. It will be available to everyone in the U.S. by the end of the week. Lyft’s All-Access plan costs $299 per month for 30 rides (up to $15 each). Let’s say your ride goes over $15, you would just pay the difference. All other rides past the initial 30 you take that month are discounted five percent. It’s worth noting that rides do not rollover.

    Lyft’s subscription product is all part of the company’s plan to get people to ditch their own cars (except the people who use their own cars to drive around Lyft customers).

    In a series of tweets, Musk said ..."~6 months before it is in all new production cars. No change to sensors. This is simple replacement of the Autopilot computer. Will be done free of charge for those who ordered full self-driving."

    Musk also tweeted that the new chip would improve the performance of Tesla's Autopilot between 500 percent and 2,000 percent.

    He said the installation of the chip would be priced at $5,000 for those who did not order full self-driving.

    Automated vehicles require careful testing before deployment on public roads.

    Automated vehicles should support the needs of human drivers and other users.

    Automated vehicles should be safe and understandable.

    Automated vehicles should be accompanied by detailed training for drivers.

    《魔鬼经济学》作者、美国经济学家Steven Levitt曾说：从很多方面来看，Uber 呈现了经济学家理想中经济应有的模样。

    Uber不仅在内部设立“研究和经济（Research and Economics）”部门，同时让这些被称为“Ubernomics”的经济学家的研究成功融入到公司的产品设计、战略设计以及政府游说支持中。

    目前经济学家在科技公司中主要负责 4 个方面的工作：
    
    1. 微观经济学方面问题，譬如价格设置和产品设计问题，研究产品是如何影响用户的；

    2. 公司发展策略问题，包括对产业的研究以及对收购、合并等行为的评估；

    3. 公共政策问题（知识版权、隐私、数据安全等），Uber拿研究报告去游说各地政府就是一个例子；

    4. 法律和政府监管问题，协助企业面对反垄断和竞争等领域的挑战。

    总的来说，智能出行，造车——包括造车的产业链的上下游，这两项至少各占了我们三分之一的侧重点和资源，工业制造是另外的三分之一。 

    把车做好了是一个几百亿美金的事情，把出行做好是过千亿美金或者是甚至大几千亿美金的生意。

    其实大家都没想明白一个问题，就是造车根本不是新造车之间的竞争，而是跟燃油车之间的竞争。很多新造车企业在忽悠各种情怀，但我们说“别把消费者当傻子”，他可能听你忽悠情怀，来参加的你发布会，真的让他掏钱时，他会做最现实的选择——他一定是拿你的车和同等价位的燃油车去比的。

    如果我们按每公里使用成本来看，所有的网约车的平台、共享出行的平台，包括将来自动驾驶的运营平台，最后大家比拼的都是每公里的运营成本，这个成本拆解到车辆的成本，拆解到车辆运营的成本，包括燃料的成本，为什么大家说电动车会在共享平台里面未来的出行里面绝对胜出呢，因为从成本来说可能是现有燃油车的1/10都不到。

    黄明明：就是核心技术的窗口期。如果把自动驾驶放的长远一点的话，还是有挺长的时间窗口期的，但是在偏商业的运营方面可能更快落地。因为商业的运营对车、对传感器成本的要求相对比个人低很多。因为个人开车要处理的问题、面临的场景是比一个在有一定固定的场景和运营要求下自动驾驶要复杂很多。

    黄明明：其实还真的没有说咱俩定一个产业同盟计划什么的，我会经常向他求教哪些核心零部件，哪些技术在未来新的智能电动车物种上会用到的。有人问你们会想到投这个？就是我们在讨论车联网技术，包括车联网安全的时候，李想说了一句“先别扯什么车联网的安全，最基本车的数据传输现在的工业总线都支持不了，应该看他做底层设备的公司”。正好我们看到出了一家公司，我们就投了这家公司

    黄明明：是的，我大多数投资人看重自动驾驶的人工智能、强算法去投资，比如投一些无人驾驶研究的团队。所以特别懂人工智能和算法的团队比较受到主流一线美元基金的亲睐，估值也会很高。而我们投的这两个团队（知行汽车、流深光电）会跟投资人说，人工智能很重要，但现阶段用不到，现阶段需要的是一些基本的东西，对车辆的控制以及多传感器融合，而且是符合车规的、低成本的传感器的融合。有些团队拿一个动辄是几百万的传感器设备、强服务器设备的样车做一个方案，用户是无法承担得起这么高额成本的。

    黄明明：我觉得这是两个不同的时间点，产生资本的回报可长可短。但是像车和家李想这样的，他可能认为整个电动车，不要说下半场到来，可能连开场的口哨还没有吹响呢，车都还没面市，而且现在做的大多数是一代的电动车的1.0——只是纯电动车的，2.0是智能化汽车，3.0是具有自动驾驶的汽车，这是一个长跑，所以每个企业家对汽车出行产业的终局看法和判断是不一样的，但是他和产生回报是两回事情，这就是为什么经常老有人问我说，觉得有一些很不靠谱的公司估值涨的那么高，我们就说可能估值和产业价值会有时间上严重的背离，但是我们希望投的是那种真正在长期能够有核心价值的公司。

    On Wednesday, Waymo — a unit of Google parent company Alphabet — released a plan for how officers can interact with its cars.

    The basic idea: Police, fire departments and other first responders can call a 24/7 telephone hotline to speak to Waymo representatives, giving them the car license plate and location. Officers — or passengers — can also press a “Live Help” button inside the car on the ceiling to reach Waymo reps.

    The hardest maneuver for an autonomous vehicle is getting on and off a fast-moving highway. That’s why most self-driving cars “are crawling around coffee shops at 20 miles per hour,” explains Amit Nisenbaum, CEO of Tactile Mobility, a Haifa-based startup that aims to give smart cars the ability to “feel the road” the way a human driver does.

14. [Self-driving stories: How 6 US cities are planning for autonomous vehicles](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/self-driving-stories-how-6-us-cities-successfully-integrated-autonomous-vehicles/)

    According to the report, Autonomous Vehicle Pilots Across America, more than 50% of US cities are currently preparing their streets for self-driving vehicles, up from less than 10% three years ago. Some of these cities have also started testing autonomous vehicles.

    Arlington, TX - In August 2017, the city began testing a 12-passenger AV shuttle on a fixed route on non-public roads as part of a partnership with Arlington's Conventions and Visitors Bureau, the report said. There are now two shuttles in operation. The shuttles are staffed with "on-board information ambassadors" who can manually operate the shuttles if necessary. Since inception, the shuttle has given more than 1,500 rides. A second phase of on-street testing is next, and the city has issued a competitive Request for Proposals (RFPs) to bring autonomous passenger vehicles to a geofenced section of the city. The expectation is for on-street AV service to debut later this fall.

    Boston, MA - In 2015, the city applied to the US DoT's Smart City Challenge (which was won by Columbus, OH) and began mulling over what Boston's streets would look like in the future. Boston didn't win the Challenge, but used the research to focus on mobility and in September 2016 was recognized by the World Economic Forum as a focus city for future mobility. In January 2017, Boston began an AV pilot program on a fixed route with a rideshare program, working with nuTonomy and Optimus Ride. It was recently announced that it would expand throughout Boston, according to the report.

    Portland, OR - In the summer of 2017, the city opened a Request For Information to see how AVs could benefit Portland's existing public transit system. City officials are currently evaluating the 19 applications to figure out which projects to pursue. The goal is to provide service to people, not providing specific vehicles. The pilot is expected to reach city streets in 2019.

    Pittsburgh, PA - In 2016, Pittsburgh Mayor Bill Peduto agreed to allow Uber to start an AV pilot program. There is no written agreement with Uber, or with the other four companies that have since launched AVs on the city's streets. By not pinning it down to writing, it allows the companies to stay nimble and embrace innovation. As noted in the report, another RFP is expected to open this year for the next chapter of AVs in the city of Pittsburgh with a focus on public transportation and first mile/last mile gaps. Use cases might include micro transit, medium-sized shuttles or city buses.

    San Jose, CA - This California city is interested in having shared autonomous electric vehicles to integrate with public transit as part of a public-private partnership. After realizing some major tech companies in the area were using city streets for private testing, city officials decided to take an active role in shaping how self-driving vehicles would affect San Jose. The city hosted a roundtable with the mayor and more than 30 private sector AV developers as well as US DoT officials, and in June 2017, began seeking AV developers to work with the city. Vehicles are expected to roll out in early 2019, the report noted, and the current plan is for a fixed-route pilot with established pick up and drop off points.

    Chandler, AZ - Chandler is basically a suburb to the south of Phoenix, and it's home to several large tech companies, including Intel, NXP Semiconductors, and Rogers Corp. The General Motors IT Innovation Center is also located in Chandler, and many other auto manufacturers have long had facilities in the area, since it's a hotbed for vehicle testing. AVs were first tested in the city in 2015, and autonomous vehicles have had a city-wide presence since 2016, as the city hosted some of the country's first AV testing on public roads. The city serves as a facilitator for AVs, with the state as a regulator. The city has tested emergency response vehicles on a closed track, and it's amended its zoning development code to reduce parking requirements by up to 40%, allowing passenger loading zones for drop-off and pick-up spots for AVs and ridesharing.

    数据显示，2017年，中国邮轮旅客出入境人次为495.5万，同比增长8%。值得一提的是，过去十年，中国邮轮旅游客流量增速大多保持在40%~50%，甚至更高。
    
    中国邮轮旅游客流量增速大幅放缓的同时，越来越多的外资豪华邮轮正在“逃离”中国市场。

    在中国旅游研究院副研究员黄璜看来，中国邮轮市场还尚未到饱和的阶段，此时增速放缓且有企业退出，并不是一种正常现象。他认为，出现这样一种情况，根本原因在于中国居民休闲时间不足、上班族“有钱无假”。

    诺唯真游轮CEO弗兰克接受媒体采访时曾透露，喜悦号驶离中国市场，并最终定位于阿拉斯加航线，是因为公司更加看重欧美游客船上的二次消费能力，而这一切都是中国游客所不具备的。
    
    据《2017年中国邮轮发展报告》，2017年，世界各地游客在嘉年华邮轮累计二次消费达到100亿美元，包括在邮轮酒吧、高档餐厅、健身房以及免税店等二次消费，占整体嘉年华邮轮2017年全年年收入的7.3%。

Dubbed Uber Works, the service would provide waiters, security guards and other temporary staffers to business partners, a source close to Uber told TechCrunch.

10. [WHY PEOPLE KEEP REAR-ENDING SELF-DRIVING CARS](https://www.wired.com/story/self-driving-car-crashes-rear-endings-why-charts-statistics/)

    Unfortunately, the publicly available data is quite limited. These are companies in a competitive field, and they don’t voluntarily share much in the way of details. They invite the press or public officials into their vehicles only in tightly controlled situations where they perform well. And anecdotal evidence of weaknesses—like The Information’s report that Waymo cars have trouble with left turns into traffic and frustrate human drivers—is well, anecdotal.

    But combine that with the fact that the computer was in charge in 22 of those 28 rear-end crashes, and you have reason to believe that the AVs are doing something that makes cars behind them more likely to hit them.
