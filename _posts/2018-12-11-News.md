1. [5层20条匝道通往8个方向，这座桥让导航哭了](https://www.huxiu.com/article/275844.html)

    重庆的黄桷湾立交桥上下总计5层，共有20条匝道，通往8个方向，连北京的西直门立交桥在它面前也是个弟中弟。如此复杂的立交桥，不禁引发讨论：上桥后导航都是崩溃的、一个匝道走错就是重庆一日游……然而，事实上它的设计非常科学，完全不用担心迷路。

2. [投资者热情骤降，电动滑板车巨头Bird 和Lime估值均大降](https://36kr.com/p/5166332.html)

    据外媒报道，投资者对共享电动滑板车的狂热正在降温，两家领先的初创企业不得不下调了它们的融资目标，而且它们还必须应付各种破坏活动、日益激烈的竞争和其他发展阵痛。

    一些公司报告称，每辆电动滑板车每天的收入超过20美元，鉴于每辆电动滑板车的成本约为500美元，这表明它们有很大的潜在利润。

6. [Uber files confidentially for IPO](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/07/uber-files-confidentially-for-ipo/)

    The company on Friday filed confidentially for an IPO, marking the beginning of a race to the stock markets for the two ride-hailing giants.

    Uber’s  most recent private market valuation was a whopping $72 billion, though the nearly 10-year-old business reportedly expects Wall Street to value it at as much as $120 billion in what will easily be one of the most highly anticipated IPOs of the decade.

7. [SoftBank invests in parking startup ParkJockey pushing valuation to $1 billion](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/10/softbank-invests-in-parking-startup-parkjockey-pushing-valuation-to-1-billion/)

    SoftBank continues to invest in the future of transportation — this time in ParkJockey, a startup that has built a technology platform aimed at monetizing parking lots. And ParkJockey, which was founded in 2013, is already using that capital to scale up.

    Along with the SoftBank investment news, ParkJockey also announced that it was acquiring two of the largest parking operators in North America. The startup, with help from Abu Dhabi-based Mubadala Capital and debt financing from Owl Rock, said it had reached an agreement to acquire Imperial Parking Corporation, a North American-based parking management company often referred to as Impark. The agreement follows ParkJockey’s acquisition of parking management operator Citizens Parking Inc.

    Miami-based ParkJockey developed a parking management platform that helps commercial property owners better monetize parking lots as well as handle operations at large venues and stadiums. The company’s platform offers features like automatic license plate recognition and pay-by-app, among others.  The company’s app also can be used by drivers to find parking spaces more efficiently.

8. [Self-driving companies must prepare for the future even if they're not ready — down to the VR and laser patents](https://www.post-gazette.com/business/tech-news/2018/12/09/uber-argo-ai-patents-intellectual-property-pittsburgh-ford-self-driving-autonomous-cars/stories/201812090004)

    While there’s no guarantee you’ll be sliding into an autonomous, virtual world on your way to work in 10, 20 or even 50 years, San Francisco-based Uber wants the right to exercise that concept if and when the time comes. 

    That means securing intellectual property by building a solid patent portfolio. Unlike some major companies that stack up troves of patents to not only protect their own inventions but to sell to smaller firms, companies in the self-driving space generally believe quality, not quantity, is key. 

    “We want to have a very efficient patent portfolio ... where every asset is achieving some strategic goal,” Mr. Storm said. “That could mean protecting against competitors, sending a message to investors or demonstrating something to the public.”

11. [Israeli inventor of car cameras says self-driving vehicles are future of artificial intelligence](http://www2.philly.com/news/self-driving-car-20181210.html)

    Amnon Shashua, cofounder and chief technology officer of the Israeli company Mobileye, lives and works at the vanguard of self-driving cars.

    “Autonomous vehicles are really just a platform for artificial intelligence,” he told a rapt audience at an event hosted by the American Friends of Hebrew University in Center City. That’s essentially a computer that can perceive risks and make split-second driving decisions.

    “Cars are the ideal platform for AI — requiring intelligence, perception, decision-making. Very much like playing chess," he explained. In addition, “imagine a world where a family only needs one self-driving car. It can drop your kids off at school, then you at work, then go pick up your groceries at the store by itself.”
