1. [Car pride and its bidirectional relations with car ownership: Case studies in New York City and Houston](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418308929)

    - Motivation: The car fulfills not only instrumental transportation functions, but also holds important symbolic and affective meaning for its owners and users. 
    - Findings:
        - We find that car pride is higher in Houston than in New York City.
        - positive and statistically significant relations exist from car pride to car ownership

2. [Research joint ventures and technological proximity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319300058)

    - Motivation: research joint ventures (RJV)
    - Research Gap: research joint ventures (RJV) in a setting where knowledge spillovers increase with the technological proximity between firms.
    - Findings: 
        - RJVs do not generally outperform competitive research with respect to innovative output and social welfare; 
        - technological proximity and the intensity of collaboration play a decisive role for the private and social benefits of a RJV;
        - joint research combined with complete knowledge sharing does not generally outperform less intensive collaboration forms.

3. [Temporal Unknown Incremental Clustering Model for Analysis of Traffic Surveillance Videos](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8384026)

    - Motivation: Optimized scene representation is an important characteristic of a framework for detecting abnormalities on live videos.
    - Research gaps:
        - detecting abnormalities in live videos is real-time detection of objects in a non-parametric way.
        - efficiently represent the state of objects temporally across frames.
    - Proposed method:
        - a Gibbs sampling-based heuristic model referred to as temporal unknown incremental clustering has been proposed to cluster pixels with motion. 

4. [A novel classification method for paper-reviewer recommendation](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11192-018-2726-6)

    - Motivation: Reviewer recommendation
    - Research gap: many unsupervised recommendation methods have been researched to solve this task. not supervised method.
    - Proposed method: a novel classification method named Word Mover’s Distance–Constructive Covering Algorithm (WMD–CCA, for short)
        - First, the submission or the reviewer is represented as some vectors by a word embedding method
        - Second, the Word Mover’s Distance (WMD, for short) method is used to measure the minimum distances between submissions and reviewers. 
        - finally, the reviewer recommendation task is transformed into a classification problem which is solved by a supervised learning method- Constructive Covering Algorithm (CCA, for short)
