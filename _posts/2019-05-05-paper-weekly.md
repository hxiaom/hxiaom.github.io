1. [Car pride and its bidirectional relations with car ownership: Case studies in New York City and Houston](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418308929)

    - Motivation: The car fulfills not only instrumental transportation functions, but also holds important symbolic and affective meaning for its owners and users. 
    - Findings:
        - We find that car pride is higher in Houston than in New York City.
        - positive and statistically significant relations exist from car pride to car ownership

2. [Research joint ventures and technological proximity](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733319300058)

    - Motivation: research joint ventures (RJV)
    - Research Gap: research joint ventures (RJV) in a setting where knowledge spillovers increase with the technological proximity between firms.
    - Findings: 
        - RJVs do not generally outperform competitive research with respect to innovative output and social welfare; 
        - technological proximity and the intensity of collaboration play a decisive role for the private and social benefits of a RJV;
        - joint research combined with complete knowledge sharing does not generally outperform less intensive collaboration forms.
