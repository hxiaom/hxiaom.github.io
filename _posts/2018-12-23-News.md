1. [戴威收到“限制消费令”，子女上私校也成问题？](https://36kr.com/p/5168601.html)

    限制消费令传出，有赞CEO白鸦对此提出疑问：明明是ofo公司欠钱，又不是戴威欠钱，为什么要限制他个人的消费？难道是和股东签了连带责任？尤其是子女上学问题，家人有钱送孩子好学校也不可以吗？腾讯科技对此采访了北京安理律师事务所管理合伙人王新锐为我们做出解答。

    限制消费令通常情况下是执行人的公司发生了在被大量的起诉情况。比如不论是ofo和乐视网，都不否认公司遇到了资金债务问题，没有钱偿还债务。即便案子判定之后，公司还是没有资金偿还。

    王新锐向腾讯科技表示：“限制消费令的目的在于敦促被执行人去履行债务。按照法律规定，被执行人为单位的，其法定代表人、主要负责人、影响债务履行的直接责任人员、实际控制人也要限制消费。而戴威是作为ofo的主要负责人或实际控制人。因为被执行人的财产不一定能被全部查到，限制消费令会给其增加不小的压力，使得相关人在日常生活和商业方面受到影响，从而敦促执行人通过各种方式甚至通过私人财产来偿还债务。

    而对于限制子女上高收费私立学校的条例，王新锐表示：“这条在限消令里说的很明确。允许去申请，但法院批不批就是另一回事了。实践中普遍还是以实际履行债务来申请解除限消令。”

    While more than 60 companies have received permits to test their driverless vehicles in California, Zoox has become the first permitted to actually transport people in those vehicles. The California Public Utilities Commission today granted Zoox a permit to participate in the state’s Autonomous Vehicle Passenger Service pilot.

    During the testing period, Zoox  must have a safety driver behind the wheel and will not be allowed to charge passengers for rides. And, as part of the program, Zoox must provide data and reports to the CPUC regarding any incidents, number of passenger miles traveled and passenger safety protocols.

3. [Lyft is getting more serious about autonomous vehicle safety with new hire](https://techcrunch.com/2018/12/20/lyft-is-getting-more-serious-about-autonomous-vehicle-safety-with-new-hire/)

    Lyft  today announced the hiring of John Maddox, founder of the American Center for Mobility and previous associate administrator of vehicle safety research at the U.S. Department of Transportation, to lead its autonomous vehicle safety and compliance efforts.

4. [Congress isn't voting on any self-driving car rules before 2019, report says](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/congress-self-driving-car-rules-no-vote/)

    Oh, and Congress won't be addressing a proposal from GM and Tesla that seeks to extend the $7,500 federal EV tax credit either. The self-driving car legislation and the tax credit proposals needed to be attached to another bill funding government operations, but they weren't, so no dice.
