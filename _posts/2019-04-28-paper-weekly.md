1. [A Graph Combination With Edge Pruning‚ÄêBased Approach for Author Name Disambiguation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24212)

    - Motivation: Author name disambiguation
    - Research gap: First, the namesake problem in which two or more authors with the same name publishes in a similar domain. Second, the diverse topic problem in which one author publishes in diverse topical domains with a different set of coauthors.
    - Proposed method: we initially propose a method named ATGEP for AND that addresses the namesake issue.
