1. [A Graph Combination With Edge Pruning‐Based Approach for Author Name Disambiguation](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24212)

    - Motivation: Author name disambiguation
    - Research gap: First, the namesake problem in which two or more authors with the same name publishes in a similar domain. Second, the diverse topic problem in which one author publishes in diverse topical domains with a different set of coauthors.
    - Proposed method: we initially propose a method named ATGEP for AND that addresses the namesake issue. 

2. [Allocation of e-car charging: Assessing the utilization of charging infrastructures by location](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418311042)

    - Motivation: The availability of charging infrastructure
    - Research question: This paper aims to examine the distribution of the allocation of future charges to the various types of charging stations in order to provide a starting point for the evaluation of the need for charging infrastructure, i.e. its number, design and cost-effectiveness.
    - Proposed method: a new approach to derive the allocation of charging processes is applied by using demographic variables and decision rules.

3. [Recommendations and privacy in the arXiv system: A simulation experiment using historical data](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/asi.24236)

    - Motivation: Recommendation and privacy.
    - Research gaps: Recommender systems may accelerate knowledge discovery in many fields. However, their users may be competitors guarding their ideas before publication or for other reasons.
    - Research work: We describe a simulation experiment to assess user privacy against targeted attacks, modeling recommendations based on co‐access data. 

4. [Dynamic ridesharing with variable-ratio charging-compensation scheme for morning commute](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191261518307689)

    - Motivation: Ridesharing, Morning commute
    - Research gap: variable-ratio charging-compensation scheme (VCS)
    - Research work: The optimal VCS without imposing road pricing when the ridesharing platform minimizes the disutility or maximizes its profit is analyzed.
