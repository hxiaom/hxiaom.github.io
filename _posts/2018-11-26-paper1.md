## Proposed method

We propose a deep learning method for event- driven stock market prediction. First, events are extracted from news text, and represented as dense vectors, trained using a novel neural tensor net- work. Second, a deep convolutional neural network is used to model both short-term and long-term in- fluences of events on stock price movements. Ex- perimental results show that our model can achieve nearly 6% improvements on S&P 500 index predic- tion and individual stock prediction, respectively, compared to state-of-the-art baseline methods. In addition, market simulation results show that our system is more capable of making profits than pre- viously reported systems trained on S&P 500 stock historical data.
