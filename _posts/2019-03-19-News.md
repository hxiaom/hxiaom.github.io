    > 顺风车对滴滴有多重要？陈宏（化名）是一位接近滴滴核心管理层的内部人士，他告诉燃财经（ID：rancaijing），顺风车业务在下线前的日均单量超过200万单、占到滴滴整体日均单量的10%，滴滴失去顺风车，就像失去左臂右膀。更关键的是，顺风车还是滴滴唯一规模盈利的业务线，2017年为滴滴贡献了8亿人民币的净利润，是影响滴滴能否整体盈利的关键一环。

    重要盈利点。

    > Systems like RSS and SFF are intended to take the information from the sensors about the other road users around the vehicle and apply a mathematically rigorous formula to any control decisions that are made in order to prevent a collision. The primary control stack can take into account a wide range of parameters such as smoothness, comfort, efficiency and obeying the rules of the road. SFF has a more constrained set of priorities, don’t cause a crash and if it's unavoidable due to other road user’s decisions, mitigate the unsafe condition.
