1. [北汽新能源：比BYD不足，比蔚来有余](https://www.huxiu.com/article/265576.html)

    9月27日，停牌两年的SST前锋更名为“北汽蓝谷”并在上交所恢复交易（代码仍为600733.SH）。这意味着北汽新能源借壳上市正式完成，成为A股第一家纯电动车制造企业。
    
    除北汽集团及其一致行动股东之外，北汽蓝谷35家股东还包括产业链上下游合作伙伴及战略投资机构。作为他们的代表，宁德时代总裁周佳、戴姆勒大中华区投资副总裁冷炎出席了更名及上市仪式，北汽集团董事长徐和宜敲响了复牌交易的钟声。
    
    复牌首日的股价走势很不给嘉宾面子，由于没有涨跌幅限制，盘中两度熔段，最终跌幅达36.88%。次日（9月28日），北汽蓝谷开盘不久即封于涨停，市值达350.6亿。两个交易日的总换手率约为14%。“十一”假期结束后，北汽新能源逆势涨停，市值达385.8亿。

    略大参考8日从接近ofo核心人士处获得的一份投资意向书显示，滴滴在8月份曾提出以20亿美金的估值收购ofo，坐实了此前的市场传言。
    
    值得关注的是，在这份投资意向书中，滴滴提出新董事会将由5名成员组成，其中2名成员由滴滴任命，1名成员由所有创始人共同任命，2名成员由滴滴以外的其他投资者任命。包括CEO等在内的所有关键岗位必须由滴滴提名、任命、替换或解雇。

4. [飞机能拉多少人？1200人我不信](https://www.huxiu.com/article/265954.html)

    当前最大的民用客机是空中客车公司的A380飞机。数据显示这架飞机最多可以布排868个乘客座位，但这么大的飞机通常都被用来远途飞行，为了保证舒适性，航空公司一般只安排400~500个座位——所以，头等舱才会异常豪华舒适哇！
    
    人类历史上“装人最多”的飞行记录则是由波音747-200型飞机在1991年创造的。当时为了撤侨，以色列航空的一架波音747货机装载了大约1200人从埃塞俄比亚安全飞回。波音747现在已经发展到了747-8  ，但航空公司一般也只安排400~500个座位。

5. [特斯拉Model 3产能大增：七天注册1.78万车辆识别码](https://36kr.com/p/5156354.html)

    据外媒报道，特斯拉在过去七天总计注册了17863个Model 3车辆识别码，其中仅在过去的周末就注册了13000个，显示出这款汽车的产能正在进一步增大。

    Twitter账户@Model3VINs对特斯拉的车辆识别码注册情况进行了追踪，它发现，在最新注册的批次中，双引擎版的Model 3数量有所增加。比如在上周日，特斯拉新注册了6425个Model 3识别码，其中全部是双引擎版。而在特斯拉本月早些时候注册的4609个Model 3车辆识别码中，有约85%是双引擎版。随着新批次的加入，特斯拉自去年7月开始Model 3的量产以来已经为这款汽车总计注册了135771个车辆识别码。

    目前，Model 3产能仅有特斯拉的最终目标每周1万辆的一半左右，但即便如此，竞争对手已经开始感受到这款汽车的存在。

6. [戴姆勒想要拉上吉利，一块在中国投资网约车生意](https://36kr.com/p/5156355.html)

    据知情人士称，戴姆勒股份公司正在与其最大的投资者合作，开始在中国提供网约车服务，在行业领军企业滴滴出行的本土市场与其展开竞争。

    其中一位知情人士称，这家德国制造商正与李书福旗下的浙江吉利控股集团有限公司商谈，考虑设立各持股50%的合资企业来提供上述服务。由于相关计划未公开，知情人士不愿透露姓名。知情人士称，相关讨论尚未最终完成。戴姆勒和吉利的发言人均不予置评。

7. [戴姆勒或与吉利在华成立网约车合资公司 争抢万亿共享出行蛋糕](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s/17MvDuXXIq-BLhY8xKiuyg)

    目前美国和欧洲的车企、供应商、经销商的利润中有85%来自拥车/驾驶/零售模式，通过新形态汽车销售与出行方式扩开拓更多服务市场成为汽车巨头的重要战略。

    普华永道思略特《2017年数字化汽车报告》预测，2030年全球汽车市场将形成复杂的竞争格局，最终集中为无人驾驶，而共享无人驾驶汽车将占到汽车总行驶里程的25%-37%，美国、欧洲和中国共享出行的市场价值将达到1.5万亿美元，从2017年到2030年的年增长率为24%。

    在1.5万亿美元的市场盘子中，2030年中国共享出行服务业的市场规模预测将为5640亿美元。2017年-2030年中国共享出行服务业的年增长率为32%。

    报告认为，在纯无人驾驶型共享出行场景下，家庭在出行方面的开支将减少20%。如果车商想继续占据竞争优势，则需要调整战略，投入大量资源渗透到出行市场，采用新的多元化战略。

    据他透露，这几个月来有不少认识的网约车司机都回老家重开“黑车”了，也有个别的成了正规“的哥”，至于彻底转行的更不在少数。这形势也让他更加纠结，是否应该趁行业严寒全面到来之前，尽快找份靠谱的新工作。

9. [京东汽车将流量入口转向“小白汽车”，但要自己做好这门生意不容易](https://36kr.com/p/5156313.html)

    近日，亿欧汽车报道称，易鑫在京东的流量入口发生改变，此前，京东商城的汽车页面直接跳转链接是易鑫的线上渠道“淘车”平台，现在，这一跳转链接改为了京东自建的购车平台，在京东金融的“汽车分期”板块出现了“小白汽车”产品。

    公开资料显示，2017年7月，京东金融联合第1车贷共同推出了“小白用车”新车信贷产品，打着“先用一年，可退可换”口号。用户通过京东金融APP，支付低额首付及低额月供获得新车，一年期满后可以选择一次性结清尾款、分期付款、置换新车或退还车辆等方案。

    京东一直都很看好汽车新零售市场。早在推出“小白用车”之前，京东在2015年就以现金和独家资源的形式为易车注资了11.5亿美元，获得了易车的董事席位，并为易车旗下的汽车金融子公司易鑫继续注资，还将自己的车贷频道交给了易鑫独立运营。

10. [Ford’s patent lets you pilot a self-driving car with your phone](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/ford-patent-self-driving-car-phone-steering/)

    The patent describes multiple ways this could happen. First, the device could be used as an ersatz steering wheel. After the system detects a request to handoff the responsibility of driving from vehicle to person, it will sync the device to the vehicle, determining a "base" position for the wheel. After that, you can rotate the device to steer the vehicle, like you would in a mobile game.

    The other mode is slightly different. Instead of using the angle of the device to change the vehicle's steering angle, it would put a virtual steering wheel on the device's touchscreen, which the user could then manipulate with a finger to create the desired wheel angle.

    Both vehicle modes would leave some control -- accelerating and braking, for example -- with the vehicle. The patent also lays out a number of ways that the vehicle could pair with a given device, from serial numbers to email addresses. The patent also claims that any device with an accelerometer, gyroscope and some method of pairing (wired or wireless) will work with the system.

    It all sounds a bit vague, but that's fine. Like many patents, the tech outlined in this document may never see the light of day. Automakers routinely patent ideas in the hope that competitors won't come up with something similar and attempt to bring it to market first. Ford's steering wheel laptop mount immediately comes to mind in this scenario. Nevertheless, it's interesting to see the ways in which engineers envision the future of driving, automated or otherwise.

11. [Alphabet's Waymo Is Now in the 'Prove It' Stage of its Self-Driving Journey](https://www.thestreet.com/opinion/alphabet-s-waymo-is-now-in-the-prove-it-stage-of-its-self-driving-journey-14736954)

    Waymo has seen a pickup in negative coverage in recent months.There are two distinct reasons for this. One is a better understanding of the reluctance that many top-tier automakers still have when it comes to partnering with Waymo, in spite of its considerable hardware and software advances. The other is a better appreciation of how much more work needs to be done before autonomous cars are ready to take over from human drivers in most (never mind all) real-life situations.

    Bloomberg added that over the last two months, Honda workers were able to "examine Cruise's code and get a close look at [its] technology," something that Waymo doesn't like to do. It also noted that Waymo likely wouldn't have been willing to sell a stake to Honda the way that Cruise did.

    As Gartner analyst Mike Ramsey has noted, autonomous driving has entered the trough of disillusionment -- the point within the technology hype cycle where excessive initial hype about the technology's pending adoption has given way to excessive pessimism. And while Waymo isn't by any means the only autonomous driving player to be hurt by this shift in perceptions, it has taken more of a hit than most peers.

12. [Ford Taps VR To Gauge Consumer Reactions To Self-Driving Car Signals](https://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/326133/ford-taps-vr-to-gauge-consumer-reactions-to-self-d.html)

    Ford is proposing a universal communications interface for cars that people can understand.

    “Today, we’re calling on all self-driving vehicle developers, automakers and technology companies who are committed to deploying SAE level-4 vehicles—and believe these vehicles should communicate intent—to join us and share ideas to create an industry standard for communicating driving intent, whether it be driving, yielding or accelerating from a stop,” stated John Shutko, Ford’s human factors technical specialist for self-driving vehicles in a blog post.

    So-called Level 4 vehicles can drive themselves but have the ability for a driver to intervene if something goes wrong, basically autonomous vehicles with a manual override.

    Three different lights scenarios were tested, signaling the vehicle is about to come to a full stop, lights indicating the vehicle intends to proceed on its current course and lights indicating the vehicle is beginning to accelerate from a stop.
    
    Another virtual reality test found that it took about two exposures for participants to learn what a single signal meant and five to 10 exposures to understand the meaning of all three lighting patterns.

15. [Is Japan Heading Towards A Self-Driving Revolution?](https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/321336)

    Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe announced in June that the country will begin testing a driverless car system on public roads sometime this fiscal year with the goal of launching a self-driving car service for the 2020 Tokyo Olympics. The government also plans to commercialize this system as early as 2022.

    Next up is Japanese automobile giant Toyota Motor that set up a strategic partnership and joint venture called MONET Technologies Corporation with SoftBank this month. The new company MONET will facilitate the creation of new mobility services.

16. [Self-driving cars on Minnesota streets? Grant will help researchers prepare](https://www.twincities.com/2018/10/08/self-driving-cars-on-minnesota-streets-grant-will-help-researchers-prepare/)

    University of Minnesota researchers received a $1.75 million grant to continue studying the future impact of self-driving vehicles.

    The 3-year grant from the National Science Foundation will research connecting communities with self-driving cars through shared data and will recommend guidelines for future transportation projects.
