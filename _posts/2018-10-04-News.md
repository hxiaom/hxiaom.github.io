1. [大股东预测：2030年的特斯拉市值将达1万亿美元](https://36kr.com/p/5155852.html)

    网易科技讯10月3日消息，特斯拉主要股东Ron Baron周二告诉CNBC，特斯拉到2030年市值可能达到1万亿美元。

    他说：“我认为这可能是一笔5000亿美元的电池业务加上一笔5000亿美元的汽车业务。我认为特斯拉在2030年成为一家超过1万亿美元的公司的机会超过50％。而我认为它有80％的机会在三年内成为一家价值600亿美元的公司。”

    Baron预测道：“我认为特斯拉将成为最大的汽车公司，他们每年将销售1000万辆到1500万辆汽车。”

    预计特斯拉本周将公布其最新的汽车产量和交付数量。 根据电动车博客Electrek的说法，特斯拉在过去三个月里制造了大约8万辆汽车。

3. [A SELF-DRIVING TRUCK STARTUP KEEPS IT SIMPLE, STUPID](https://www.wired.com/story/ike-self-driving-truck-startup-nuro-software-deal/)

    The robots are still coming, the software developers and hardware mavens and balance-sheet-wielding CEOs insist. But more and more, they emphasize that this work is hard, the **problems varied, the risks manifold, the regulations slow in coming.** Even Waymo, the putative leader in the industry, flush with Alphabet funding—which plans to launch a commercial service this quarter—is having trouble teaching computers to be competent drivers.

    The team picked trucks over cars so they can focus on relatively simple highway driving.

    Instead of building its own autonomous vehicle software stack, it's licensing one from Nuro. The two-year-old self-driving startup focuses on delivery robots; the company launched its first pilot project with the grocer Kroger in June.

    “This type of licensing arrangement seems rather new in the AV space," says Raj Rajkumar, an electrical and computer engineer who studies autonomous technology at Carnegie Mellon University. It might be a sign that once-unlimited autonomous vehicle startup funding is now limited, and that companies are getting creative with money.

    But the team is most excited about Nuro’s software architecture, which it says gives its engineers an easy-to-use foundation for its testing. Sun estimates the license will save Ike about two years (and 50 to 60 employees’ worth) of work.

    In June, one of Waymo’s self-driving Chrysler Pacifica minivans crashed on the freeway outside of the company’s office in Mountain View, California, after its lone safety driver fell asleep at the wheel.
