## AV 3.0 Provides New Multimodal Safety Guidance

• Affirms the approach outlined in A Vision
for Safety 2.0 and encourages automated
driving system developers to make their
Voluntary Safety Self-Assessments public to
increase transparency and confidence in
the technology.

• Provides considerations and best practices
for State and local governments to support
the safe and effective testing and operation
of automation technologies.

• Supports the development of voluntary
technical standards and approaches as an
effective non-regulatory means to advance
the integration of automation technologies
into the transportation system.

• Describes an illustrative framework of safety
risk management stages along the path to
full commercial integration of automated
vehicles. This framework promotes the
benefits of safe deployment while managing
risk and provides clarity to the public
regarding the distinctions between various
stages of testing and full deployment.

• Affirms the Department is continuing its work
to preserve the ability for transportation
safety applications to function in the 5.9 GHz
spectrum.

## AV 3.0 Clarifies Policy and Roles

Automation technologies are new and rapidly evolving. The right approach to achieving safety improvements begins with a focus on removing unnecessary barriers and issuing voluntary guidance, rather than regulations that could stifle innovation.

AV 3.0 outlines how automation will be safely integrated across passenger vehicles, commercial vehicles, on-road transit, and the roadways on which they operate.

• States that U.S. DOT will interpret and,
consistent with all applicable notice
and comment requirements, adapt the
definitions of “driver” and “operator”
to recognize that such terms do not
refer exclusively to a human, but may
include an automated system.

• Recognizes that given the rapid increase in
automated vehicle testing activities in many
locations, there is no need for U.S. DOT to
favor particular locations or to pick winners
and losers. Therefore, the Department
no longer recognizes the designations of
ten Automated Vehicle Proving Grounds
announced on January 19, 2017.

• Urges States and localities to work to
remove barriers—such as unnecessary and
incompatible regulations—to automated
vehicle technologies and to support
interoperability.

• Affirms U.S. DOT’s authority to establish
motor vehicle safety standards that allow for
innovative automated vehicle designs—
such as vehicles without steering wheels,
pedals, or mirrors—and notes that such an
approach may require a more fundamental
revamping of the National Highway Traffic
Safety Administration’s (NHTSA) approach
to safety standards for application to
automated vehicles.

• Reaffirms U.S. DOT's reliance on a selfcertification
approach, rather than type
approval, as the way to balance and
promote safety and innovation; U.S. DOT will
continue to advance this approach with the
international community

• Clarifies that, rather than requiring a onesize-
fits-all approach, the Federal Transit
Administration will provide transit agencies
with tailored technical assistance as they
develop an appropriate safety management
system approach to ensuring safe testing
and deployment of automated transit bus
systems.
