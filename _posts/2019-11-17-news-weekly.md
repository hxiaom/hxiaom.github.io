7. Kalter, Marie-José Olde, Lissy La Paix Puello, and Karst T. Geurs. "Do changes in travellers’ attitudes towards car use and ownership over time affect travel mode choice? A latent transition approach in the Netherlands." Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice 132 (2020): 1-17.

    - Research question: This paper examines how changes in travellers’ attitudes towards car use and ownership change over time and how these changes influence car use
    - Findings:
        - Four latent classes were found to reflect the participants’ attitudes: cost-sensitive, car-minded, environmentally aware and social-conscious travellers
        - Only when younger adults face life events, such as moving, starting a job or become parents, transitioning to more car-oriented profiles appears more likely. 
        - Changes in attitudes towards car use and car ownership do not significantly affect car use (number of trips per day), except for the social-conscious travellers who switched to the car- minded class
