## Motivation

The taxi is a flexible transportation system that everyone can move to any destination. However, in Japan, the charge for the taxi is more expensive than other transportation facilities. The taxi business is in a very tough situation because the cost of crude oil suddenly increased in addition to the influence of the over-supply of the taxi market. Recently, the application of Information Technologies has advanced on taxi industries (e.g., the fare payment by non-contact IC and car navigation system). One of the technologies that gain such the attention is a probe system which can store a large amount of customer trajectory data. The probe system will improve the profitability of taxi companies if the demand in the future can be forecasted from the statistics.

One of the technologies for transportation systems in the spotlight is a taxi probe systemwhich provides historical data of taxi (i.e., latitude and longitude when a taxi picks up a customer). Taxi probe data is just beginning to be applied to a variety of uses.

## Research question

In this paper, we try to forecast the taxi demands by using the taxi probe data.

## Taxi Probe Data

The taxi probe data we used are offered by Tokyo Musen Taxi 1. The probe data are recorded from February 1st to March 31, 2009, and the travel region of taxis is in Tokyo’s 23 wards, Mitaka-shi, and Musashino-shi.

## Demand Forecasting by Neural Network

### Training Data Set

We have taxi probe data during two months (i.e., February 1st to March 31, 2009). Thus, the data of first month (i.e., February 1st to 28) are used as training data set, and the data of last month (i.e., March 1st to 31) are used as validation data set.

## Proposed method

Therefore, in this paper, we try to forecast the taxi demands from the taxi probe data by a neural network (i.e., multilayer perceptron). First, we analyze the statistics of the taxi demands and make the training data set for the neural network. Then, the back-propagation learning is applied to the neural network to reveal the relationship of regions in the Tokyo(i.e., 23-words, Mitaka-shi, and Musashino-shi).

## Result

We found that day of the week is important factor for demand forecasting because the demands occur periodically in a week. Furthermore, the demand forecasting in business town like Chuo-Ku is more easy compared to bed town like Edogawa-Ku. However, the amount of precipitation is ineffective because we considered whether the rain falls or not.
