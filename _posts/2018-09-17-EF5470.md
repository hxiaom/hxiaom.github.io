## Part I Introduction to Econometrics

### Chapter 1 Economic Questions and Data

At a broad level, econometrics is the science and art of using **economic theory** and **statistical techniques** to analyze **economic data**.

#### 1.1 Economic Questions We Examine

Four questions as example

- Question #1: Does Reducing Class Size Improve Elementray School Education?
- Question #2: Is There Racial Discrimination in the Market for Home Loans?
- Question #3: How Much Do Cigarette Taxes Reduce Smoking?
- Question #4: By How Much Will U.S. GDP Grow Next Year?

Each of these questions requires a **numerical answer**. **Economic theory** provides clues about that answer but the actual value of the number must be learned **empirically**, that is, by analyzing data. Because we use data to answer quantitative questions, our answers always have some **uncertainty**: A different set of data would produce a different numerical answer. Therefore, the conceptual framework for the analysis needs to provide **both** a **numerical answer** to the question and a **measure of how precise** the answer is.

The conceptual framework used in this book is the **multiple regression model**, the mainstay of econometrics.

#### 1.2 Causal Effects and Idealized Experiments

Questions in econometrics concern **causal relationships** among variables. **Causality** means that a specific action leads to a specific, measureable consequence.

**Estimation of Causal Effects**

One way to measure causal effect is to conduct an **experiment**: **randomized controlled experment**.

**Forecasting and Causality**

Another kind of questions econometrics concerned about are **forecasting**. Even though forecasting need not involve causal realtionships, economic theory suggests **patterns and relationships** that might be useful for forecasting.

#### 1.3 Data: Sources and Types

In econometrics, data come from one of two sources: **experiments** or **nonexperimental observations** of the world.

Three main types of data: **cross-sectional data, time series data, and panel data**.

**Experimental Versus Observational Data**

Expriments: **expensive, difficult to administer, sometimes unethical**.

Observational data: **difficult to sort out the effect of the "treatment" from other relecant factors**.

**Cross-Sectional Data**

Data on different entities for a single time period are called cross-sectional data.

**Time Series Data**

Time series data are for a single entity collected at multiple time periods.

**Panel Data**

Panel data, also called longitudinal data, are data for multiple entities in which each entity is observed at two or more time periods.

### Chapter 2 Review of Probability

Most aspects of the world around us have an element of **randomness**. The theory of probability provides mathematical tools for **quantifying and describing this randomness**.

#### 2.1 Random Variables and Probability Distributions

The **mutually exclusive** potential results of a random process are called the **outcomes**.

The **probability** of an outcome is the proportion of the time that the outcome occurs in the long run.

The set of all possible outcomes is called the **sample space**.

An **event** is a subset of the sample space, that is, an event is a set of one or more outcomes.

A **random variable** is a **numerical summary** of a random outcome.

**Probability Distribution of a Discrete Random Variable**

The **probability distribution** of a discrete random variables is the list of all possible values of the variable and the probability that each value will occur.

cumulative probability distribution is also referred to as a cumulative distribution function (c.d.f.).

the outcomes are 0 or 1. A binary random variable is called a **Bernoulli random variable**, and its probability distribution is called the **The Bernoulli distribution**

**Probability Distribution of a Continuous Random Variable**

for coninuous variables, the probability is summarized by the **probability density function**. A probability density function is also called a p.d.f.

#### 2.2 Expected Values, Mean, and Variance

**The Expected Value of a Random Variable**

The **expected value** of a random variable Y, denoted E(Y), is the **long-run average value** of the random variable over **many repeated trials or occurrences**.

The expected value of Y is also called the **expectation** of Y or the **mean** of Y.

**The Standard Deviation and Variance**

The variance and standard deviation measure the **dispersion** or the **"spread"** of a probability distribution.

var(Y) = E[(Y-u_Y)^2]
