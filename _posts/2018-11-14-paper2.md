Chang H, Tai Y, Hsu J Y. Context-aware taxi demand hotspots prediction[J]. International Journal of Business Intelligence and Data Mining, 2010, 5(1): 3.

## Motivation

In an urban area, the demand for taxis is not always matched up with the supply.

According to the Institute of Transportation (IOT) Survey of Taxi Operation Conditions in Taiwan Area 2006, in average, each taxi driver operated the business 9.9 h a day, driving approximately 147.3 km. However, about one-third of the time, 3.2 h, drivers were on the roads without taking passengers. The time and energy wasting phenomenon is more severe in Taipei urban area. Taipei City Department of Transportation reported that in over 60–73% of their operation hours, taxi drivers were driving without passengers. This roaming situation not only wastes energy but pollutes the environment. 

One of the reasons for driving an unoccupied vehicle is that taxi drivers do not know where potential customers are, leaving them with no choice but to wander around the city. The goal of this research is to predict the areas with potential demand from contexts and past history.

## Related work

Our work is different from the above in that GPS trace records have strong spatial-temporal continuity, but taxi request records are not. In addition, GPS traces are from individuals and more personalised, while taxi requests are with less personalised factor.

OptiTaxi2 is a taxi management service provided by Correlation Systems Ltd.
OptiTaxi predicts the demand for taxi services according to locations and time, attemping to maximise profits of the entire taxi fleet. However, the locations as the units of demand prediction are pre-defined and fixed in the OptiTaxi system. In our work, we adopt clustering techniques to dynamically generate the areas from the demand history.

## Proposed method

This paper proposes mining historical data to predict demand distributions with respect to contexts of time, weather, and taxi location. The four-step process consists of data filtering, clustering, semantic annotation, and hotness calculation. The results of three clustering algorithms are compared and demonstrated in a web mash-up application to show that context-aware demand prediction can help improve the management of taxi fleets.

## Data

The current location dataset is built based on the research data version 1.4 provided by the Institute of Transportation (IOT), MOTC, Taiwan. http://www.iot.gov.tw/english/ct.asp?xItem=187765&ctNode=2272

## Contribution

The contribution of this work is an application to solve the context-aware pattern mining from taxi request records by adapting existing approaches from clustering. Through the process, customer demand can be understood
