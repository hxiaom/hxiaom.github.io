1. [“印度版滴滴” Ola 已经把烧钱策略复制到了海外，会有效吗？](https://36kr.com/p/5160985.html)

    乘客补贴加司机奖励曾是 Ola 在印度本土市场百试不爽的“秘方”，如今，这一策略被搬到了海外市场。

    11月6日，总部位于班加罗尔的 Ola 正式进军新西兰，开始在奥克兰、惠灵顿和克赖斯特彻奇三个城市提供网约车服务。上线首月，Ola 向乘客提供低至5折的优惠，并且只收取司机9%的佣金。

    “Ola 为新西兰人提供了另一种安全、实惠的出行选择。对司机而言，我们收取更低的佣金，让他们赚更多的钱，”公司在11月6日的新闻稿中表示。

    创立7年以来，Ola 一直在自掏腰包补贴司机和乘客。然而，随着全球初创企业融资越来越难，为了维持运营，公司需要开始关注营收。

    可是，由于司机已经习惯了高收入，Ola 提高佣金的尝试进行得并不顺利。

    就在本月，Ola 和Uber 的司机刚刚在印度的金融中心孟买举行了一场长达两周的罢工，以表达他们对收入降低、佣金上涨和奖励减少日益增长的不满。

    几名司机告诉 Quartz，他们的收入在过去两年里已经从每月8-9万卢比（7600-8500人民币）跌至5-6万卢比 (4700-5700 人民币)。

2. [为什么说传统的公交系统比“共享出行”更靠谱？](https://36kr.com/p/5160616.html)

    微型公交，还有支持者称之为“公交优步”，可以说是“拨号出行”的新瓶装旧酒，这是一种响应即时需求的公交，比如一辆公交车在附近，人们可以拨打电话，让公交车带自己去想去的地方，或者到哪个公交枢纽站。公交车也可能在途中停下来等其他人。在美国有数百种这种服务。作为一名交通规划顾问，我已经设计了25年的叫车服务。

    微型公交跟智能手机结合起来之后，迎来了新的发展。智能手机使得用户可以比用以前更短的时间预订行程，而且不需要打电话了。但是由于技术原因，微型公交的效率几乎和打电话的时候一样低。

3. [马斯克卸任董事长，好事还是坏事？](https://36kr.com/p/5161129.html)

    特斯拉董事长换人了，不再是马斯克。据彭博社今日报道，特斯拉董事会提名独立董事 Robyn Denholm出任董事长，任命即刻生效。

    此前因为“私有化风波”特斯拉董事长兼首席执行官马斯克遭到了美国证券交易委员会(SEC)的证券欺诈指控。根据9月底马斯克与SEC签订的和解协议，马斯克同意在45天内辞去特斯拉董事长的职务，但将继续担任首席执行官一职。此后三年之内，他没有再次被推选为董事长的资格。同时，他将缴纳2000万美元的罚款。

5. [The Future of Safe Self-Driving Cars Is Thermal Imaging](https://jalopnik.com/the-future-of-safe-self-driving-cars-is-thermal-imaging-1830317629)

    Many of these systems don’t yet use thermal imaging, but after a demonstration of how effective it is at identifying objects, I’m not sure I’d get in a self-driving car that didn’t have it.

    (Full Disclosure: FLIR wanted me to see how its thermal imaging technology could be easily incorporated into self-driving cars so their PR team showed up at our office with a Chevy Suburban with some cameras mounted to the roof. It was driven by a human but they still got the point across.)

    FLIR, which claims to have about a 70 percent market share in thermal imaging technology but is not the only thermal imaging company trying to get in the self-driving game, has already offered automotive applications for the last few years in the form of visual driver assistance systems in high end cars from BMW, Mercedes, Audi and others. In this form, a display in the car uses the thermal imaging as a form of night vision to help spot animals and pedestrians in the road at night.

    The biggest issue with thermal imaging is the prohibitively expensive cost of thermal imaging cameras, which can be over $1,000 per unit, which may be too much to ask of companies that may find the technology redundant. But the company is confident that it can get the cost of the cameras below $1,000 as more companies incorporate the technology into their self driving cars. The other main issue with the tech is its limited functionality as a backup, additional passive layer to imaging systems.

6. [Self-driving cars could function as moving brothels, academics predict](https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/2018/11/07/brothels-could-move-self-driving-cars-academics-predict/)

    Brothels could move into self-driving cars, British academics predict.

    A paper by researchers at the University of Surrey and Oxford suggests that "pay-per-hour" hotel rooms are likely to be replaced by autonomous cars when the technology is introduced.

    "While SCAVs [shared, connected autonomous vehicles] will likely be monitored to deter passengers having sex or using drugs in them, and to prevent violence, such surveillance may be rapidly overcome, disabled or removed. 

    The study titled "Autonomous vehicles and the future of urban tourism", published in the Annals of Tourism Research, also suggests that the budget hotel and flight industry could suffer if the cars are introduced, as travellers opt to sleep in their cars and travel overnight between cities that they might otherwise have flown between. 

    They could also herald the end of the coach trip, as tourists who might have opted for a coach tour choose the greater freedom and independence that comes with travelling by car without having to worry about driving or finding parking spaces. 

    This could lead to congestion and traffic in tourist hotspots, the researchers warned.

    “The emphasis was on keeping safety at the top of our minds as we looked into the technologies and look into deploying those down the road, even if it’s way down the road,” said Matthew Conde, government affairs director for AAA in Idaho.
