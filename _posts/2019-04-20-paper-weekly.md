1. [Road tests of self-driving vehicles: Affective and cognitive pathways in acceptance formation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418307183)

    - Motivation: autonomous vehicles
    - Research gap: the pathways (affective vs. cognitive) that guide peopleâ€™s acceptance of road tests (ART) for self-driving vehicles (SDVs) and behavioral intention (BI) to use SDVs
    - Findings: two behavioral responses (i.e., ART and BI) based on the trust heuristic and affect heuristic.
