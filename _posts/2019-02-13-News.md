    The battle between Uber  and Lyft, which are both expected to go public this year, continues. Today, Lyft announced the hire of Michelle DeBella, formerly Uber’s global head of internal audit, as its own VP of finance strategy.

2. [In The Race For Self-Driving People Movers, May Mobility Could Beat Waymo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lianeyvkoff/2019/02/12/in-the-race-for-self-driving-people-movers-may-mobility-could-beat-waymo/#5d9be5e4627f)

    While automotive companies and technology giants are racing to make cars drive themselves on the open road, a Michigan-based start-up is taking a smaller approach that could beat everyone to the punch.

    "The prototypes and the preproduction vehicles that the team is building here at TRI-AD are going to be … the most intelligent supercomputer on wheels," Kuffner said late last month at TRI-AD's temporary office near Tokyo Station. "We've called it the moonshot of my generation to build this technology and bring it to market."

    **可能性较低，因为即使技术成熟，还有赖于政策和市场。这个时候如何给团队定目标？如果考虑政策和市场定目标，那可能永远都不会努力去影响政策和市场。这样的目标虽然不一定能完成，但也许是个好目标。**
