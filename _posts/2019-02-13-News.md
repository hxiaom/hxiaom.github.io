1. [Lyft brings on Uber’s former global head of internal audit](https://techcrunch.com/2019/02/12/lyft-brings-on-ubers-former-global-head-of-internal-audit/)

    The battle between Uber  and Lyft, which are both expected to go public this year, continues. Today, Lyft announced the hire of Michelle DeBella, formerly Uber’s global head of internal audit, as its own VP of finance strategy.

    **有巨头就有老二。**

2. [In The Race For Self-Driving People Movers, May Mobility Could Beat Waymo](https://www.forbes.com/sites/lianeyvkoff/2019/02/12/in-the-race-for-self-driving-people-movers-may-mobility-could-beat-waymo/#5d9be5e4627f)

    While automotive companies and technology giants are racing to make cars drive themselves on the open road, a Michigan-based start-up is taking a smaller approach that could beat everyone to the punch. May Mobility is already operating low-speed, driverless shuttles in Michigan and Ohio, and has closed its Series A fund that will allow it expand its services to other cities.

    May Mobility is tackling a part of the $28 billion "last mile" problem that many commuters encounter when using public transportation by replacing large, diesel busses with a fleet of electric, self-driving vehicles that transports people along a carefully planned and defined route. 

    **May Mobility采用不同策略，低速，固定路线，解决最后一公里，先把客户运营起来。之后自动驾驶技术应该不是掌握在一家公司手上，也容易获得。关键可能还在于如何运营自动驾驶车辆。**

3. [REPORT: TOYOTA WILL HAVE A SELF-DRIVING CAR FOR SALE IN A YEAR](https://autoweek.com/article/autonomous-cars/report-toyota-will-have-self-driving-car-sale-year)

    "The prototypes and the preproduction vehicles that the team is building here at TRI-AD are going to be … the most intelligent supercomputer on wheels," Kuffner said late last month at TRI-AD's temporary office near Tokyo Station. "We've called it the moonshot of my generation to build this technology and bring it to market."

    **可能性较低，因为即使技术成熟，还有赖于政策和市场。这个时候如何给团队定目标？如果考虑政策和市场定目标，那可能永远都不会努力去影响政策和市场。这样的目标虽然不一定能完成，但也许是个好目标。**

    **自行车不是一个问题。和行人一样解决。**

5. [36氪独家 传滴滴2018年亏损109亿，司机补贴113亿元](https://36kr.com/p/5176634.html)

    36氪得到的一份滴滴出行内部流传出来的财务数据显示，该公司2018年持续巨额亏损，全年亏损高达109亿元人民币。同时，2018年全年滴滴在司机补贴方面投入共计113亿元。

    去年9月，一封滴滴内部邮件曾显示，滴滴在2018年上半年亏损达40.4亿元。这也意味着，滴滴在2018年下半年的亏损达到68.6亿元。

    而36氪了解到，2017年滴滴全年亏损25亿元人民币。

    **全年司机补贴113亿，意味着每天补贴0.3亿。假如每天3000万订单，意味着每个订单补贴1元钱，这样看并不算高。关键在于如何定义补贴，这补贴是转嫁到乘客，还是滴滴自身承担。要保持和同行的竞争，滴滴能够维持多少的抽成？滴滴平台的价值（更多客户，更好的服务）体现到每个订单中又值多少钱？滴滴也许不是共享出行的终局，最终在出行上会有差异化的竞争对手。自动驾驶出租车的运营和现在的出行平台的运营最大的差别又在哪里？**
