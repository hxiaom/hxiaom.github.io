Willing C, Klemmer K, Brandt T, et al. Moving in time and space–Location intelligence for carsharing decision support[J]. Decision Support Systems, 2017, 99: 75-85.

## Research goal

In this paperwe develop a spatial decision support systemthat assists free-floating carsharing providers in coun- tering imbalances between vehicle supply and customer demand in existing business areas and reduces the risk ofimbalancewhen expanding the carsharing business to a new city.

## Research question

RQ 1: How does carsharing usage vary over time and space, and what drives these variations? 

RQ 2: How can FFCS operators decide on the operating area when entering a new city?

## Carsharing relocation problem

In general, relocation strategies can be divided into two approaches: operator-based relocation and user-based relocation.
