1. [整车上市企业三季度业绩报忧：七成净利下滑，商用车企集体“沦陷”](https://36kr.com/p/5160472.html)

    中国车市下滑的压力在上市公司的财务报表中体现的淋漓尽致。截至10月31日，A股23家上市整车企业三季度财报悉数出炉。经济观察报记者通过梳理发现，23家企业中前三季度取得净利增长的仅有6家，净利减少的为17家，净利减少者比例超过7成。这样惨淡的三季度在“金九银十”的消费旺季非常少见。

    36氪获悉，由「飞步科技」研发、具备自主知识产权的国产 28nm 深度学习加速器，已于今年 9 月在台积电完成流片。飞步科技表示，此次流片的 28 nm 感知深度学习加速器具有>1GHz的运算频率和>4TOPs的计算能力，支持 L3 / L4 级的实时数据处理需求，并且功耗与算力方面已接近量产无人驾驶汽车需求。此次成功流片，也是为飞步感知系统芯片（代号：凤凰-100）完成核心技术攻坚。

    今年 6 月，36氪曾报道，由前滴滴研究院院长创办的无人驾驶技术研发商飞步科技，已获创新工场融资，同时公布了首要技术落地领域——无人驾驶货车。

    针对无人驾驶 AI 芯片，飞步科技认为难点在于“三高一低”：

    无人驾驶对芯片算力要求高，车速越快，路况信息越多，计算平台的压力负荷就越大；

    无人驾驶对终端计算的实时性要求高，稍有滞后就可能发生意外（要求决策速度）；

    芯片的可靠性要求高，无人驾驶环境下不允许出现任何死机情况，且即使在严寒酷暑、刮风下雨等恶劣天气条件下，也需要芯片保持稳定的计算和续航能力。尤其是飞步科技主攻的物流商用车，对于温度、防震等方面会要求比较高；

    芯片的能耗“越低越好”，未来 AI 芯片在处理海量数据时如果能够保持低功耗，车辆才能拥有更强的续航能力。

3. [Inside VW, Mobileye’s deal to launch an autonomous ride-hailing service in Israel](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/inside-vw-mobileyes-deal-to-launch-a-autonomous-ride-hailing-service-in-israel/)

    In the world of autonomous vehicles, the news comes in repetitive short bursts with formulaic precision: Company X is launching a robotaxi fleet/test program in city Y by [insert date]. These announcements are promptly forgotten until the first self-driving vehicles are spotted, an accident occurs or a new partner joins the test program. Rinse. repeat.

    The recent announcement between VW Group, Intel’s  computer vision subsidiary Mobileye  and Champion Motors was treated no differently. The Volkswagen Group, Intel’s Mobileye and Champion Motors said they plan to deploy Israel’s first self-driving ride-hailing service in 2019 through a joint venture called New Mobility in Israel.

4. [How to get to the polls for free at the 2018 midterm elections](https://techcrunch.com/2018/11/05/how-to-get-to-the-polls-for-free-at-the-2018-midterm-elections/)

    In case you haven’t heard, polls will open Tuesday morning across the U.S. for the 2018 midterm elections. It’s a big deal, so go vote.

    And this year, there are more free ways to get to the polls than ever before thanks to a variety of non-partisan “get the vote out” campaigns from ride-hailing, bike sharing and scooter companies.

    Here’s a handy list.

    By bike

    Motivate,  one of the largest bike share operators in North America, has launched an Election Day campaign to give people in nine urban areas access to free bikes for the day.

    Motivate  operates Citi Bike in New York & Jersey City; Divvy in Chicago; Bluebikes  in the Boston metro area; Capital Bikeshare in Washington D.C.; Nice Ride Minnesota  in Minneapolis; Ford GoBike  in the San Francisco Bay Area); BIKETOWN  in Portland, Oregon; and CoGo in Columbus, Ohio.

    Lime  is also offering free access to its fleet of electric bikes on Election Day. Users just need to enter the code LIME2VOTE18 to unlock any of its shared bikes or electric bikes.

    By car

    Depending how far you are from the polls, these ride-hailing offers could be free. At least one way.

    Uber  is giving $10 off a single ride to the polls on Election Day on the most affordable Uber option available in your city (Express POOL, POOL, or UberX, in that order). To access, open the app and then tap menu > payment > add promo code. Enter the promo code VOTE2018. Users should then request their ride using Uber’s polling place locator, right in the Uber app.

    Lyft is working with Vote.org, Nonprofit Vote, TurboVote and other organizations to distribute codes to those who need them. The ride-hailing company is offering 50% of rides and free rides in underserved communities.

    By public transit

    A number of transit agencies in some of the country’s largest cities are offering free rides, including Houston, Dallas, Tampa and San Antonio. This year,  the Los Angeles Metro system, which serves more than 1.3 million passengers daily, is joining in.

    By scooter

    Lime is offering free access to its fleet of electric scooters on Nov. 6. Users enter the same code, LIME2VOTE18, to unlock any of its scooters, or its shared and electric bikes. The free rides to and from your polling location last up to 30 minutes and are available in more than 100 cities across the U.S.

5. [This Startup Wants to Bring 'Common Sense' to Self-Driving Cars](http://fortune.com/2018/11/05/isee-self-driving-cars/)

    A little-known name in the world of autonomous driving is paving the way for a new type of self-driving car—one that can use “common sense,” as the company calls it, to navigate an uncontrolled environment.

    While most companies developing self-driving cars are focused on improving sensors, perception, and control, iSee CEO Yibiao Zhao says his company is the first to work on creating a robot that can really understand what’s going on.

    Zhao founded iSee just about a year ago along with Chris Baker, his lab partner at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and Debbie Yu, who has a history with tech startups. The three are supported by MIT’s venture capital firm, The Engine, in Cambridge, Mass.

6. [Which of These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Leads the Self-Driving Race?](https://investorplace.com/2018/11/which-of-these-3-semiconductor-stocks-leads-the-self-driving-race/)

    Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) may not be the first semiconductor stock that comes to mind when thinking of the self-driving revolution, but its $15.3 billion purchase of Mobileye last year immediately made it a strong contender in the sector.

    One of the biggest catalysts here is INTC’s partnership with Volkswagen (OTCMKTS:VLKAF) and Champion Motors. It was recently announced that the companies plan to roll out a fleet of self-driving vehicles — fueled by Mobileye’s software technology — in Israel next year. The service is expected to be fully operational by 2022.

    Intel’s size and ability to scale combined with the technology it acquired from Mobileye make it a key player among other semiconductor stocks. I expect its push into autonomous vehicles will generate large revenue in the years ahead and ultimately impact INTC’s bottom line — and share price — substantially.

    Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) isn’t a major player in the self-driving car space just yet, but I suspect it will be soon. Why? Because while the company has historically lagged INTC when it comes to both the innovation of new chips and transitions into new high-growth sectors, it typically follows in INTC’s footsteps.

    The shift may have already begun. Rumors that AMD will start providing chips to self-driving auto manufacturers have floated around. Still, the company appears to be watching from afar right now.

    There is no urgent reason to jump into AMD today. In fact, I am staying away from it for several reasons. Unless the business model changes soon, it may be too late to the party.

    Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) always seems to be in all the right places. It is a leading chip maker for video games and the esports industry. And during the cryptocurrency craze, the demand for NVDA’s high-performance chips was through the roof.

    Now, the boom in self-driving vehicles is once again driving demand for the company’s products.

    NVDA is the leading chip maker for autonomous vehicle platforms and boasts more than 350 customers in the space, making it one of the most appealing semiconductor stocks to buy. However, there were some negative headlines last month when Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) announced it would no longer use NVDA’s chips and instead develop its own.

    This should be a one-off event. I do not anticipate the majority of auto manufacturers will begin making their own chips, so NVDA should continue to enjoy strong demand.
