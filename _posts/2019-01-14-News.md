    At CES, this year’s discussions about future autonomy focused on more accurate and lower-cost sensor technologies and the use of artificial intelligence to provide greater safety benefits through greater deployment of assistive technologies.

    AUDI: Through the VR technology, backseat riders can immerse themselves in different universes that work together with the car and its infotainment systems and interior.

    TuSimple is hitting the accelerator on its effort to develop a fleet of self-driving commercial trucks in Tucson, adding trucks to meet early demand even before its trucks go fully autonomous.

    The company, which has more than 100 local employees and is planning to add some 500 over the next two years, says it already has 12 undisclosed contracted customers, “including Fortune 100 and large international companies.”
