Kalra N, Paddock S M. Driving to safety: How many miles of driving would it take to demonstrate autonomous vehicle reliability?[J]. Transportation Research Part A: Policy and Practice, 2016, 94: 182-193.

## Motivation

How safe are autonomous vehicles? The answer is critical for determining how autono- mous vehicles may shape motor vehicle safety and public health, and for developing sound policies to govern their deployment.

## Research question


## Model

In this paper, we calculate the number of miles of driving that would be needed to provide clear statistical evidence of autonomous vehicle safety

## Result

we show that fully autonomous vehicles would have to be driven hundreds of millions of miles and sometimes hundreds of billions of miles to demonstrate their reliability in terms of fatalities and injuries
