Sun C Y, Lee A J T. Tour recommendations by mining photo sharing social media[J]. Decision Support Systems, 2017, 101: 28-39.

## Motivation

With the increasing popularity of photo and video sharing social networks, more and more people have shared their photos or videos with their family members and friends.

in this paper, we propose a framework for recommending top-k tours tomeet user's interest and time frame by usinguser-generated contents in a photo sharing social network.

## Contribution

The contributions of the proposed framework are summarized as follows. 

First, unlikemost previous methods recommending tours landmark by landmark, our framework recommends tours area by area so that users can avoid going back and forth from one area to another and save plenty of time on transportation, which in turn can visit more landmarks. 

Second, we category the hashtags posted by users into landmark topics, and then use these topics to characterize landmarks and users. 

Third, we develop a method to recommend top-k tours with highest scores for users by further considering visiting time and visiting order of areas. Thus, the recommended tours can meet user's interest and time frame. 

Fourth, the experiment results show that our proposed method outperforms the comparing method. 

Finally, our proposed framework may help users plan their trips and customize a trip for each user.
