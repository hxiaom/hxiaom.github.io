Li X, Pan G, Wu Z, et al. Prediction of urban human mobility using large-scale taxi traces and its applications[J]. Frontiers of Computer Science, 2012, 6(1): 111-121.

## Motivation

much information regarding human mobility, such as location, motion, and behaviors of vehicles, is becoming easily accessible. From these digital footprints, it is feasible for researchers to extract social and community intelligence [1], ranging from urban environmentdynamics [2,3] to social events [4,5].

## Research question

This work focuses on predicting humanmobility fromdiscovering patterns of in the number of passenger pick-ups quantity (PUQ) from urban hotspots.

## Method

This paper proposes an improved ARIMA based prediction method to forecast the spatial-temporal variation of passengers in a hotspot.

### Data set preprocessing and hotspot extraction
