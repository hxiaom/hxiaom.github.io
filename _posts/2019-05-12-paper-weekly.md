1. [Understanding bike sharing use over time by employing extended technology continuance theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418316768#!)

    - Motivation: Facilitating users’ continuance intentions and retaining consumers are important to bike sharing service providers and governments. 
    - Theory: Following extended technology continuance theory and incorporating perceived risk, we aim to identify factors that affect bike sharing services’ continuance intentions in this study. 
    - Findings: 
        - the extended technology continuance theory could provide a strong rationale in the investigation of continuance intention to adopt bike sharing services.
        - Perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and attitude are positively associated with continuance intention. 
        - Perceived usefulness also positively impacts satisfaction and attitude. 
        - Perceived risk tends to be negatively related to satisfaction. 
        - Perceived ease of use is positively associated with perceived usefulness and attitude.
