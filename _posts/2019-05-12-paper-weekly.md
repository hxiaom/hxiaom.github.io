1. [Understanding bike sharing use over time by employing extended technology continuance theory](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418316768#!)

    - Motivation: Facilitating users’ continuance intentions and retaining consumers are important to bike sharing service providers and governments. 
    - Theory: Following extended technology continuance theory and incorporating perceived risk, we aim to identify factors that affect bike sharing services’ continuance intentions in this study. 
    - Findings: 
        - the extended technology continuance theory could provide a strong rationale in the investigation of continuance intention to adopt bike sharing services.
        - Perceived usefulness, satisfaction, and attitude are positively associated with continuance intention. 
        - Perceived usefulness also positively impacts satisfaction and attitude. 
        - Perceived risk tends to be negatively related to satisfaction. 
        - Perceived ease of use is positively associated with perceived usefulness and attitude.

2. [Identification, Characterization, and Prediction of Traffic Flow Patterns in Multi-Airport Systems](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8373742)

    - Motivation: Efficient planning of airport capacity
    - Research gap: the dynamic and uncertain behavior of capacity-determining factors makes it difficult to estimate flow rates precisely, especially for strategic planning horizons.
    - Proposed method:  a data-driven framework to identify, characterize, and predict traffic flow patterns in the terminal area of multi-airport systems toward improved capacity planning decision support in complex airspace. 

3. [Scheduling the Operation of a Connected Vehicular Network Using Deep Reinforcement Learning](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8365853)

    - Motivation: Internet of Vehicles (IoV)
    - Research gap: satisfy the driver’s well-being and demand for continuous connectivity in the IoV era.
    - Proposed method: this paper addresses both safety and quality-of-service (QoS) concerns in a green, balanced, connected, and efficient vehicular network. Using the recent advances in training deep neural networks, we exploit the deep reinforcement learning model, namely deep Q-network, which learns a scheduling policy from high-dimensional inputs corresponding to the current characteristics of the underlying model.

4. [A longitudinal analysis of the effectiveness of California’s ban on cellphone use while driving](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0965856418313272)

    - Motivation: In California, the use of handheld cellphones while driving has been prohibited since July 1, 2008.
    - Findings: interrupted time series analysis
        - The ban was found effective in reducing the cellphone usage-caused crashes in terms of both crash frequency and crash proportion. 
        - crashes caused by cellphone use produce more severe outcomes than other crashes.
        - the ban motivates drivers to switch from handheld cellphones to hands-free cellphones, but in terms of crash severity, hands-free cellphone usage and handheld cellphone usage do not show significant differences. 

5. [An Evaluation of HTM and LSTM for Short-Term Arterial Traffic Flow Prediction](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8424074)

    - Motivation: big data + machine learning
    - Research gap: leverage the increasingly large amounts of traffic volume data to improve traffic flow prediction and the detection of anomalous traffic flows
    - Proposed method: hierarchical temporal memory (HTM) for short-term prediction of traffic flows over real-world Sydney Coordinated Adaptive Traffic System data on arterial roads in the Adelaide metropolitan area in South Australia. Results are compared with those from long–short-term memory (LSTM).
        - HTM has potential as an effective tool for short term traffic flow prediction with results on par with LSTM and improvements when traffic flow distributions change.
