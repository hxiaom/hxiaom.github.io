1. [吉利+戴姆勒=？](https://www.huxiu.com/article/268394.html)

    今年年初的时候戴姆勒官方发言人证实吉利董事长李书福持有其9.69%的股份，股份价值约90亿美元。这意味李书福成为戴姆勒最大的股东，拥有逾1.036亿股的投票权。

    在这多半年的时间内，有关吉利和戴姆勒合作的传闻传出了不少，今天终于有了些靠谱的官宣：10月24日，戴姆勒出行服务有限责任公司与浙江吉利控股集团管理的吉利集团（新业务）有限公司宣布：双方将在华组建合资公司，提供高端专车出行服务。

    更多的细节是：公司总部设在杭州，双方持股比例为50:50。计划在中国的部分城市提供高端专车出行服务，使用高端车型将包括但不限于梅赛德斯-奔驰品牌。初期车型包括梅赛德斯-奔驰S级车、E级车、V级豪华多功能车以及梅赛德斯-迈巴赫轿车，未来也将使用吉利集团旗下高端纯电动车型。

    成立合资公司提供出行服务，双方其实都有一些各自的经验。

    同样是今年年初的时候，戴姆勒其实就提出过“瞰思战略”（CASE），并强调：变革正在开启，戴姆勒集团将从四个方面打造技术平台，即智能互联 （Connected）、自动驾驶（Autonomous）、共享出行（Shared & Services）和电力驱动 （Electric）。

    目前戴姆勒已经在全球市场做了一些出行领域的布局，其中就包括一些分时租赁用车以及专车服务，用户超过 2000 万。在中国市场目前正在运营的 Car2go 和 Car2share 两个共享汽车项目也有几十万的注册用户。

    而吉利这一边，其实已经在出行领域有了一些布局，在国内有市场占有率不低的曹操专车。目前曹操专车在国内已经有了 1700 万注册用户。

    自去年在华销量创下新高之后，捷豹路虎今年的销量表现开始掉头向下。9月数据出炉，捷豹路虎在华销量同比下跌46.2%，仅有7439辆。捷豹路虎方面表示，销量下滑的原因主要是进口关税变化导致了市场不确定性，持续的贸易紧张局势抑制了消费者的购买需求。

    数据显示，我国同城货运市场规模呈逐年增长趋势，2017年，同城货运市场总额突破1万亿元，预计到 2018年底，市场总额将达到1.2万亿元。同城货运市场潜力巨大，自然不缺玩家，「搬运帮」则是同城货运新崛起的竞争者之一。

5. [Self-driving cars will have to decide who should live and who should die. Here’s who humans would kill](https://www.washingtonpost.com/science/2018/10/24/self-driving-cars-will-have-decide-who-should-live-who-should-die-heres-who-humans-would-kill/?utm_term=.b730761eaa16)

    The study, published in Nature, identified a few preferences that were strongest: People opt to save people over pets, to spare the many over the few and to save children and pregnant women over older people. But it also found other preferences for sparing women over men, athletes over obese people and higher status people, such as executives, instead of homeless people or criminals. There were also cultural differences in the degree, for example, that people would prefer to save younger people over the elderly in a cluster of mostly Asian countries.

    “We don’t suggest that [policymakers] should cater to the public’s preferences. They just need to be aware of it, to expect a possible reaction when something happens. If, in an accident, a kid does not get special treatment, there might be some public reaction,” said Edmond Awad, a computer scientist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Media Lab who led the work.

    “Building these cars, the process is not really about saying, ‘If I’m faced with this dilemma, who am I going to kill.’ It’s saying, 'If we can imagine a situation where this dilemma could occur, what prior decision should I have made to avoid this?” Kuipers said.

6. [GM's self-driving car reportedly has trouble recognizing pedestrians](https://www.engadget.com/2018/10/24/gm-self-driving-car-has-trouble-recognizing-pedestrians/)

    It seems that General Motors' self-driving car unit, Cruise, is running into major difficulties, and will likely not be able to hit its late 2019 launch target. Sources close to the project have told Reuters that engineers have been hitting unexpected technical challenges, like being able to detect objects if objects are in motion. For example, vehicles would hesitate or stop when passing a row of parked bicycles, would mistakenly see "phantom bicycles" that caused jerky stops, and would even fail to recognize pedestrians. "Nothing is on schedule," one GM source told Reuters, as Cruise has already missed mileage targets and milestones.

    GM isn't the only one betting on Cruise succeeding, however. Earlier this month, Honda bought a $2.75 billion stake in Cruise, a sum that will be paid over the next 12 years. And along with Honda, Japanese company Softbank threw down $2.25 billion into the project (more than half of that will come after Cruise commercially launches).

    For Cruise CEO Kyle Vogt, safety is the determining factor before an official public launch. And it's not just Cruise facing challenges, but others, including BMW, Tesla, Uber, Lyft, and Google's Waymo. These challenges include the ethics in choosing who lives or dies in a life-or-death situation, discerning individuals in a large group, liability, and unprotected left turns. But considering the monumental challenge in front of all these companies, billions more will need to be invested before you and I can jump in an empty robot-car that can take us to In-N-Out.

    As reported by The Washington Post today, Waymo has a new guide (PDF) that explains what its self-driving Chrysler Pacifica Hybrids is supposed to do in those situations.

8. [Self-Driving Car Industry Needs Better Metrics, DOT Official Says](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-23/self-driving-car-industry-needs-better-metrics-dot-s-kan-says)

    Autonomous vehicle manufacturers need a better yardstick to show that their products are safe, said Derek Kan, under secretary for policy at the U.S. Department of Transportation.

    The metrics that are most widely used by self-driving car developers -- miles driven and the frequency of human intervention -- alone are insufficient to demonstrate the safety of an autonomous automobile, Kan said at a conference in Washington on Tuesday.
