1. [告别中国车市白银时代](https://www.huxiu.com/article/279174.html)

    随着2018年的逝去，中国车企的白银时代可能也要过去了。而之后，充满着战争意味的车企“青铜时代”即将到来。在过去十年的白银时代中，中国车市的年产销已经从不到900万发展到3000万，处于高速增长期。这十年中，留在战场上的车企们将进入到下一个时代，伴随着这样四个关键词——政策驱动、营销失效、转型艰难和自主分化。2019年来了，车市或许会迎来新的拐点。

    At CES, driverless and auto technology will cover 300,000 square feet of floor space, more than the total size of many standalone car shows, and the auto industry is continuing to pour billions into self-driving cars. Ford Motor Co. CEO Jim Hackett said in November that the market for autonomous vehicles and other mobility services could reach $10 trillion—half the size of U.S. gross domestic product. Annual sales of self-drivers will hit 33 million by 2040 and account for more than a quarter of global vehicle deliveries, according to researcher IHS Markit.

    But a study from Deloitte suggests things will move more slowly than expected. Half of the 25,000 consumers Deloitte surveyed globally said they didn’t believe autonomous vehicles would be safe, up slightly from 47 percent a year ago. Just 39 percent of them trust automakers to bring the technology to market. Most surprising: Only 12 percent of U.S. consumers reported using services such as Uber and Lyft once a week, half the rate of a year ago.

    “The new realization is that it will be 2025 before we see that on the road. Maybe longer.” Like Lawande, Jake Fisher, director of auto testing for Consumer Reports magazine, sees more potential for autonomous technology working in concert with humans. Fisher says the gear could be especially useful for long-haul truckers and highway drivers.

    Apparently, if the self-driving Uber was stopped, it would take up to an hour to reboot, limiting the amount of time and number of miles it could log during testing that day.
