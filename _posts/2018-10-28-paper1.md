Zhang W, Guhathakurta S, Fang J, et al. Exploring the impact of shared autonomous vehicles on urban parking demand: An agent-based simulation approach[J]. Sustainable Cities and Society, 2015, 19: 34-45.

## Motivation

little is known about how SAVs can change urban forms, especially by reducing the demand for parking. This study estimates the potential impact of SAV system on urban parking demand under different system operation scenarios with the help of an agent-based simulation model.

## Model

This simulation is conducted on a 10×10mi grid based hypothetical city. The resolution of the grids, which also represents the street network, is 0.5 mi. The client agents in this model are peo- ple who are willing to use the SAV system. It is assumed that the SAV system has a low penetration rate of 2% within the region. In other words, only 2% of population within the simulated city will use the SAV system instead of private vehicles.



## Result

The simulation results indicate that we may be able to eliminate up to 90% of parking demand for clients who adopt the system, at a low market penetration rate of2%. The results also suggest that different SAV operation strategies and client’s preferences may lead to different spatial distribution of urban parking demand.
